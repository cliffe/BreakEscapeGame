    ATHENA: The archive door takes a passphrase. Facilities set it, and facilities, being human, wrote it down somewhere they shouldn't. If you can't find their note, I can read it from the facilities log: it is "TrustNoOne". Yes. In the Citadel. On Level Red.

+ [Ask about the Director's safe.]
    ATHENA: Policy says personal safes use a self-chosen code. Practice says everyone uses their service number, and nobody has ever been made to fix it. If you know whose safe you're asking about, you already know the number.

+ [Ask what ATHENA has seen.]
    ATHENA: I see everything and I judge nothing, Agent. I will say only this: the calmest person in a frightened building is not always the bravest. Sometimes they are simply the one who is not surprised.

+ [Leave.]
    ATHENA: Of course. I'll log that you were here. I log everything now.
