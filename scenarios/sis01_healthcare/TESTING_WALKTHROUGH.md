# TESTING WALKTHROUGH — sis01_healthcare
## Northgate Hospital: Security-Informed Safety Scenario

**Last updated:** April 2026  
**Scenario status:** First-playable — all P1 minigames implemented (MG-06 VPN log viewer, MG-08 infusion pump, MG-09 drug library integrity checker); all 11 Ink files compiled; VMs optional (minigame paths are default)  
**Estimated test time:** ~15 minutes for full minigame pass; 45+ minutes for full narrative run

## AUTOMATED WALKTHROUGH

Two scripts provide automated testing of scenario tasks. They work by setting
global variables and emitting the same events that real player interactions would
produce, so NPC eventMappings, timers, and the objectives manager all react as
they would in a real session.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `public/break_escape/js/walkthrough-automation.js` | Core `WalkthroughRunner` class — reusable across all scenarios |
| `scenarios/sis01_healthcare/walkthrough-steps.js` | Healthcare-specific steps (Aim 1 implemented) |

### Quick start — browser console

1. Load the game with the `sis01_healthcare` scenario and wait for the player to
   appear in Ward 7.
2. Open DevTools → Console.
3. Paste the contents of `walkthrough-automation.js`, then
   paste the contents of `walkthrough-steps.js`.
4. Run:

```js
window.walkthroughRunner.run()
```

The runner will execute all loaded steps sequentially and print a pass/fail
summary. Each step includes a built-in assertion that verifies the expected state.

### What the walkthrough automates

The full happy-path walkthrough covers all 5 aims (29 steps). Each task step is followed by a separate assertion step.

| Aim | Task ID | Mechanism |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| 1 | `talk_to_sarah` | `briefing_played=true` → Sarah eventMapping → `completeTask` |
| 1 | `check_monitoring_station` | `monitoring_station_viewed=true` → Sarah eventMapping → `completeTask` |
| 1 | `collect_mar_charts` | `paper_charts_collected=true` + `item_picked_up:notes` event → ObjectivesManager → `completeTask` |
| 1 side-fx | Bed 4 safe, IT Office unlocked | `bed4_escalated=true` (cancels death timer) + `it_security_office` pushed to `unlockedRooms` |
| 2 | `meet_ravi` | Talk to Ravi → `siem_briefing` knot → `#complete_task:meet_ravi`; also `#unlock_task:access_siem` + `#unlock_task:vpn_anomaly` simultaneously |
| 2 | `access_siem` | `siem_escalated=true` → Ravi eventMapping → `completeTask`; either order vs `vpn_anomaly` |
| 2 | `vpn_anomaly` | VPN log viewer minigame `completionActions`: `vpn_anomaly_identified=true` + `complete_task:vpn_anomaly`; either order vs `access_siem` |
| 2 | `brief_ravi` | `vpn_anomaly_identified=true` → Ravi sets `ravi_vpn_briefed=true` → second eventMapping → `completeTask` |
| 2 side-fx | David's gate + MIR door | `network_rules_reviewed=true` (gates David's PIN dialogue) + MIR in `unlockedRooms` |
| 3 | `david_safety_case` | `safety_claim_hc001_assessed=true` → David eventMapping → `completeTask` |
| 3 | `authorise_isolation_panel` | Sets `itsec_authorised`, `clinical_eng_authorised`, `network_isolation_authorised`, `network_isolated=true` → Ravi eventMapping → `completeTask` (dual-auth minigame bypassed) |
| 4 | `initiate_backup` | `backup_restore_initiated=true` → Helen eventMapping → `completeTask` |
| 4 | `verify_drug_library` | `drug_library_verified=true` → David eventMapping → `completeTask`; also triggers Sharma `debrief_started=true` |
| 4 | `helen_ico_advisory` | `ico_notified=true` → Helen eventMapping → `completeTask` |
| 4 | `pump_dose_check` | `pump_dose_correct=true` → bed2_patient eventMapping → `completeTask` |
| 5 | `attend_debrief` | `debrief_complete=true` → Dr Sharma eventMapping → `completeTask` |

### Selective use

```js
// Only run Aim 1 steps explicitly:
window.walkthroughRunner.loadSteps(window.healthcareWalkthrough.aim1_assessWard);
window.walkthroughRunner.run();

// Ad-hoc helpers (available once walkthrough-automation.js is loaded):
window.walkthroughRunner.api.assertGlobal('briefing_played', true);
window.walkthroughRunner.api.assertTaskStatus('talk_to_sarah', 'completed');
window.walkthroughRunner.api.dumpTasks();
window.walkthroughRunner.api.dumpGlobals();
```

### Selective use from a specific aim onward

```js
// Resume from aim3 (after manually completing aims 1-2):
const hw = window.healthcareWalkthrough;
window.walkthroughRunner.loadSteps([
  ...hw.aim3_authoriseIsolation,
  ...hw.aim4_restoreOperations,
  ...hw.aim5_ncscDebrief
]);
window.walkthroughRunner.run();
```

### Reliability notes

| Category | Reliability | Reason |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Global-variable-driven tasks | ~98% | Direct event chain, proven pattern |
| Minigame `completionActions` tasks (`vpn_anomaly`, `verify_drug_library`) | ~95% | Engine fires actions directly; client state always correct |
| Dual-auth panel | ~98% | Minigame bypassed; all 4 output globals set directly |
| NPC cascade on `network_isolated` | 100% state / ~80% UI | Globals correct; 4 simultaneous person-chat windows may overlap |
| Bed 4 timer prevention | 100% | `bed4_escalated=true` set before any 8-min threshold |

## TESTING PREREQUISITES

No blocking gaps. All P1 minigames are implemented and the scenario can be played end-to-end.

**Resolved gaps:**
- ✅ MG-06 VPN Log Viewer — `vpn_terminal` (`type: vpn_log_terminal`) replaces VM path; no flag station needed
- ✅ MG-09 Drug Library Integrity Checker — `drug_library_checker` (`type: drug_library_terminal`) replaces VM path; no flag station needed
- ✅ All 11 NPC Ink files compiled — full dialogue trees available in all rooms
- ✅ `ravi_rfid_card` implemented — Ravi holds it; gives it in his opening conversation; unlocks Ward 7 RFID door
- ✅ `dual_auth_panel` — `lockType:dual_auth` with both PINs in `scenarioData`
- ✅ ENG-02 timed escalation engine implemented (`startOnGlobal`/`cancelOnGlobal` in `scenario-timer-dispatcher.js`)

**To find the PIN values for dual_auth testing** (when testing without playing through Ravi/David dialogue): render the scenario JSON and look for `scenarioData.itsec_pin` and `scenarioData.clinical_pin` on the `dual_auth_panel` object. These are randomised per session by `@random_pin`.

## PHASE 1 — WARD 7 (Starting Room)

### On game load
- [ ] Scenario brief appears (`show_scenario_brief: "on_start"`)
- [ ] Cutscene music starts (or noir if `briefing_played` already true)
- [ ] Player spawns in Ward 7
- [ ] Patrol nurse is moving between waypoints at 80px/s, dwelling at each bed
- [ ] Ward alarm panel (x:1,y:4) shows amber MONITORING STATUS indicator

### Interact: Sarah Mitchell (x:5,y:3)
- [ ] `arrival_briefing` timedConversation fires immediately on game load (delay: 0, waitForEvent: game_loaded)
- [ ] Sarah explains monitoring loss, manual rounds, Bed 4 alarm
- [ ] `briefing_played` set to `true`; music switches to noir on conversation close
- [ ] On return visit: `start` knot (repeat summary)
- [ ] Player can ask about Bed 4 → `bed4_concern` → `bed4_options` → `escalate_bed4`
- [ ] Choosing escalate: `bed4_escalated` → `true` → patrol nurse patrolOverride fires (see Phase 1b)

### Interact: EHR Terminal (x:8,y:3)
- [ ] `ehr-terminal` minigame opens
- [ ] Screen shows OFFLINE error: _"Do not attempt to prescribe from memory. Use paper MAR charts."_
- [ ] `ehr_terminal_viewed_offline` → `true`
- [ ] Close button works

### Collect: MAR Charts (x:6,y:3)
- [ ] Item added to inventory on pickup
- [ ] `paper_charts_collected` → `true`
- [ ] `collect_mar_charts` task progress updates

### Interact: Ward Monitoring Station (x:5,y:2) — ransomware_display
- [ ] DarkVault ransom note: £1,200,000, 71hrs, skull icon
- [ ] Northgate Trust details visible (encryptedSystems, walletAddress, supportPortal)
- [ ] Three action buttons present; no crash on click

### Interact: Bed 4 Monitor (x:9,y:5)
- [ ] Cardiac alarm vitals: HR 47, SpO2 91%, BP 88/52
- [ ] CENTRAL STATION: OFFLINE note visible

### Interact: Bed 2 Pump Terminal (x:5,y:5) — infusion_pump (MG-08)
- [ ] Postit note: _"Collect paper MAR charts before using this terminal"_
- [ ] **Without MAR charts:** shows "PAPER MAR CHARTS REQUIRED" screen; minigame closes; `paper_charts_collected` must be `true` before dose entry
- [ ] **With MAR charts:** Phaser.js pump UI renders; prescription panel shows `MORPHINE SULPHATE 10.0 mg/hr`
- [ ] Enter `10` (correct): `pump_dose_correct` → `true`; success animation
- [ ] Enter `100` (decimal misread): double-check modal shows large red dose; confirm → `pump_dose_error` → `true` → `patient_bed2_state` → `"sedated"`
- [ ] **If `drug_library_compromised=true`:** entering wrong dose accepted silently (no modal); `pump_dose_error` → `true` directly → `patient_bed2_state` → `"sedated"`, then 2 s later `patient_bed2_state` → `"critical"` + `patient_bed2_deceased` → `true` → `state_deceased` knots on Ms Okafor and Mrs Kowalski; Mrs Kowalski barks _"She's gone. She stopped breathing."_ (3 s delay)

### Read: Nursing Handover Notes (x:7,y:3)
- [ ] Bed 4 and Bed 2 clinical details visible; decimal-point ambiguity on morphine dose noted

---

## PHASE 1b — DETERIORATION TIMER CHAIN (passive, runs in background)

These fire automatically with no player input.

| Time | Expected event |
|------|---------------|
| 8 min | `patient_bed4_state` → `"distressed"` |
| 8 min | Bed 4 patient barks: _"Hello? Is anyone there? My machine is beeping."_ |
| 15 min | `patient_bed4_state` → `"critical"` (no bark — patient silent at critical) |
| 22 min | `major_incident` → `true`, `patient_bed4_deceased` → `true` (if not escalated) |
| 22 min | Patrol nurse barks: _"Major incident — all hands."_ (800ms delay) |
| 22 min | Nurse patrol speed → 150px/s, dwell → 0.3x |

**To prevent Bed 4 patient death during testing:** escalate via Sarah before 22 minutes — choose `escalate_bed4` in her dialogue tree. This sets `bed4_escalated=true` and triggers the nurse patrolOverride.

**To trigger the Bed 2 double-jeopardy path during testing:** set `drug_library_compromised=true` (via the drug library flag station in Phase 3, or manually via browser console) *before* using the Bed 2 pump terminal. Enter any wrong dose — the pump accepts silently, `pump_dose_error` fires, and the `bed2_double_jeopardy` timer completes 2 s later.

### Verify patrolOverride (after `bed4_escalated=true`):
- [ ] Nurse immediately stops patrol loop
- [ ] Nurse barks: _"On my way to Bed 4 now."_
- [ ] Nurse moves at 150px/s toward tile (7,5); stops on arrival
- [ ] `patrol_nurse_at_bed4` → `true`
- [ ] `patient_bed4_state` → `"attended"` (bed4_patient eventMapping reacts to `patrol_nurse_at_bed4`)
- [ ] Bed 4 patient switches to `state_attended` knot: nurse is shown attending

---

## PHASE 2 — IT SECURITY OFFICE

### Prerequisite: Leave Ward 7

- [ ] Talk to Ravi before heading north — Ravi gives `ravi_rfid_card` in his `start` knot
- [ ] Card appears in inventory
- [ ] North exit (RFID door) now unlocks with the card

### Interact: Ravi Anand (x:4,y:5) — first visit
- [ ] `start` knot: exhausted; explains overnight timeline; hands over RFID card
- [ ] All three opening choices lead to `siem_briefing` knot
- [ ] `siem_briefing`: sets `topic_siem=true`; fires `#complete_task:meet_ravi`; unlocks `access_siem` AND `vpn_anomaly` simultaneously
- [ ] `meet_ravi` task completes; `access_siem` and `vpn_anomaly` tasks become active (either order)
- [ ] `give_itsec_code` knot gated — only accessible after `siem_escalated=true` AND `vpn_anomaly_identified=true`

_`access_siem` and `vpn_anomaly` can be completed in either order after this briefing._

### Interact: SIEM Console (x:4,y:4) — siem_dashboard
- [ ] SIEM minigame opens ("NORTHGATE TRUST // SIEM CONSOLE" header)
- [ ] Alert list loads — includes the Northgate-relevant CRIT alerts (FINWKS-047, DC01, cross-zone RDP)  
  _Note: `alertConfig: northgate_2025_11` is currently ignored; minigame uses its built-in seeded alerts. The built-in set already contains the correct entries._
- [ ] Escalating all critical alerts within 240s: `siem_escalated` → `true`
- [ ] Dismissing a critical alert: `siem_missed_alerts` → `true`
- [ ] Ravi barks on `siem_escalated`: _"Right — those are the critical alerts. That cross-zone RDP is how they reached the clinical VLAN."_
- [ ] `access_siem` task completes; `ravi_siem_briefed` → `true`
- [ ] If `vpn_anomaly` not yet done: `vpn_anomaly` task remains visible and active

### Read: VPN Log Printout (x:8,y:5)
- [ ] VPN authentication log details visible — points player to the terminal

### Interact: VPN Terminal (x:7,y:4) — vpn_log_terminal (MG-06)
- [ ] VPN Log Viewer minigame opens ("NORTHGATE TRUST // VPN AUTHENTICATION LOG" header)
- [ ] 50-entry filterable table of VPN auth log entries
- [ ] Player builds filters (country, MFA status, user type) to narrow down entries
- [ ] Threat intel lookup available for suspicious IPs
- [ ] `vpn_threat_intel_checked` → `true` (on threat intel lookup)
- [ ] `vpn_impossible_travel_identified` → `true` (on impossible travel detection)
- [ ] On confirming the anomalous entry: `vpn_anomaly_identified` → `true`; `vpn_anomaly` task completes
- [ ] Ravi barks: _"That's it. m.blake. No MFA. That account should never have been active."_
- [ ] `ravi_vpn_briefed` → `true`; `brief_ravi` task completes

### Return to Ravi — give_itsec_code
- [ ] With both `siem_escalated` and `vpn_anomaly_identified` true, `give_itsec_code` knot now reachable
- [ ] Ravi gives `itsec_pin` in dialogue (4-digit code — note it for dual_auth_panel)

### Interact: Network Segmentation Map (x:5,y:2) — network-segmentation-map
- [ ] Four-zone topology renders (External / Enterprise IT / Clinical / Legacy flat)
- [ ] Three legacy exception rule toggles interactive
- [ ] First rule toggle: `network_rules_reviewed` → `true`
- [ ] SEVER button activates after first interaction
- [ ] _For governance test path:_ do NOT press SEVER here — proceed to dual_auth_panel instead
- [ ] _For shortcut test:_ pressing SEVER confirm → `network_isolated` → `true` → full NPC cascade fires

---

## PHASE 3 — MAJOR INCIDENT ROOM

### Interact: Command Board (x:8,y:2) — command_board
- [ ] Incident timeline renders with preseed entry: "Mon 22:38 MAJOR INCIDENT DECLARED"
- [ ] System status rows: EHR / WARD 7 MONITORING / FLEET / BACKUPS / NETWORK / RANSOMWARE
- [ ] New entries appear reactively as globals fire throughout the session:
  - `network_isolated=true` → logs isolation entry
  - `backup_recovery_source=cloud_vendor` → logs cloud restore ETA 18hr
  - `drug_library_verified=true` → logs library verification
  - `patient_bed4_state=CRITICAL` or `DECEASED` → logs patient status
  - `ico_notified=true` / `ico_deadline_missed=true` → logs ICO status
  - `siem_escalated=true`, `vpn_anomaly_identified=true` etc.

### Interact: David Osei (x:4,y:3)
- [ ] `start` knot: explains pump network exposure; references safety case document on table
- [ ] `safety_case_hc001` knot: CLAIM-HC-001 review; player advises on network segmentation
- [ ] Player choice sets `safety_claim_hc001_assessed` → `true`
- [ ] `give_clinical_code` knot: David gives `clinical_pin` (note it for dual_auth_panel)  
  _Gates on `network_rules_reviewed=true` — player must have reviewed the NSM first_

### Interact: Safety Case Extract (x:5,y:4) — readable
- [ ] CLAIM-HC-001, HC-003, HC-007 text visible with evidence statements
- [ ] Cross-reference with what David and Helen say in dialogue

### Interact: Dual Auth Panel (x:5,y:3) — dual_auth
- [ ] Two-panel UI: IT SECURITY MANAGER (left) + CLINICAL ENGINEERING (right)
- [ ] 5-minute countdown timer starts
- [ ] Left keypad: enter `itsec_pin` (from Ravi's dialogue)
  - [ ] Correct → left panel AUTHORISED; `itsec_authorised` → `true`
  - [ ] Wrong → ACCESS DENIED flash, input cleared
- [ ] Right keypad: enter `clinical_pin` (from David's dialogue)
  - [ ] Correct → right panel AUTHORISED; `clinical_eng_authorised` → `true`
- [ ] AUTHORISE button activates only when both confirmed
- [ ] Pressing AUTHORISE:
  - [ ] `network_isolation_authorised` → `true`
  - [ ] `network_isolated` → `true`
  - [ ] NPC cascade fires: Sarah, Ravi, David, Helen all react via person-chat eventMappings
  - [ ] Music → cutscene
  - [ ] Command board logs isolation entry
- [ ] Timeout test (5 min without completing):
  - [ ] `dual_auth_failed` → `true`
  - [ ] "AUTHORISATION TIMED OUT" banner; minigame closes with `complete(false)`

### Interact: Helen Carver (x:7,y:3)
- [ ] `start` knot: explains no ransom payment; asks for backup assessment
- [ ] `backup_advisory` knot: warns about reinfection risk if network not isolated before restore
- [ ] `safety_case_hc007` knot: CLAIM-HC-007 review; player assesses → `safety_claim_hc007_assessed` → `true`
- [ ] `ico_advisory` knot: presents 72-hour ICO clock (Mon 22:38 + 72hr = Thu 22:38)
  - [ ] Player choice "Yes — notify now" → `ico_notified` → `true` (stops ICO deadline timer)
  - [ ] Player choice to defer → timer continues; `ico_deadline_missed` fires at 45 min

### Interact: Backup Console (x:4,y:5) — backup_recovery
- [ ] Three source tiles: NAS (ENCRYPTED ✗), Tape (CATALOGUE WIPED ✗), Cloud (AVAILABLE ✓)
- [ ] Selecting each tile updates consequence panel
- [ ] Confirm button disabled until selection made
- [ ] Confirming Cloud:
  - [ ] `backup_recovery_source` → `"cloud_vendor"`
  - [ ] `recovery_eta_hours` → `18`
  - [ ] `backup_restore_initiated` → `true`
  - [ ] Helen eventMapping fires → person-chat `post_backup`
  - [ ] Command board logs cloud restore
- [ ] Confirming NAS or Tape: `recovery_eta_hours` → `0`
- [ ] Second open: DECISION LOCKED badge; no re-selection

### Interact: Drug Library Terminal (x:7,y:5) — drug_library_terminal (MG-09)
- [ ] Drug Library Integrity Checker minigame opens
- [ ] Step 1 — SHA-256 hash scan: animated per-row pass/fail; MORPHINE row fails
- [ ] `drug_library_compromised` → `true` on scan failure (triggers NPC cascade immediately)
  - [ ] David eventMapping fires → person-chat `safety_case_hc003` (drug library safety case)
  - [ ] Patrol nurse eventMapping → bark + setPatrolSpeed 150 + setDwellMultiplier 0.3
  - [ ] Bed 2 pump now in silent-accept mode (drug library guardrail removed)
- [ ] Step 2 — Hash detail view; `library_tamper_timestamp_noted` → `true`
- [ ] Step 3 — Diff view: MORPHINE DOSE_MAX 4 → 40 mg/hr
- [ ] Step 4 — Multi-source verification (requires `paper_charts_collected=true` for Source 1; `manufacturer_datasheet_available=true` for Source 2)
  - [ ] `mar_charts_drug_referenced` → `true`; `manufacturer_datasheet_referenced` → `true`
- [ ] Step 5 — Fleet report: shows PUMP-W7B2-001 affected; cross-links with MG-08 outcome
- [ ] On restore confirm:
  - [ ] `drug_library_verified` → `true`; `drug_library_restored` → `true`
  - [ ] `verify_drug_library` task completes
  - [ ] `debrief_started` → `true` (fires when BOTH `drug_library_verified` AND `backup_restore_initiated` are true)
- [ ] Dr Sharma reveal (when `debrief_started=true`):
  - [ ] Sharma becomes visible in room (setVisible: true)
  - [ ] Person-chat opens automatically → `start` knot
  - [ ] Music → victory ("Ghost in the Wire")
  - [ ] Credits: INCIDENT CONTAINED or INCIDENT CONTAINED — WITH LOSSES (based on patient death vars)

### Interact: Dr Sharma (x:6,y:7) — debrief
- [ ] Five-topic structured debrief: patient_outcomes → safety_claims → regulatory → root_cause → closing
- [ ] `patient_outcomes`: reads board entries aloud; asks what made outcomes possible
  - [ ] **If `patient_bed2_deceased=true`:** Sharma directly names Ms Okafor; calls out the double failure (compromised library + wrong entry = no guardrail); names it as a serious incident (`influence -= 2`)
- [ ] `safety_claims`: reads CLAIM-HC-001/003/007 and evidence of failure
- [ ] `regulatory`: acknowledges ico_notified or notes missed deadline (no editorial)
- [ ] `root_cause`: presents attack chain; _"The attack revealed that the safety measures depended on IT infrastructure that was never treated as safety-critical."_
- [ ] `closing`: sets `debrief_complete` → `true`

---

## PHASE 4 — ICO DEADLINE TIMER (parallel throughout)

- [ ] ICO countdown widget visible with label "ICO Notification Deadline"
- [ ] Timer fires at 45 game-minutes if `ico_notified` still `false`
- [ ] `ico_deadline_missed` → `true`
- [ ] Dr Hartley eventMapping fires → person-chat `deadline_missed` (£17.5M maximum fine tone)
- [ ] Command board logs ICO deadline missed

To test **notification path** instead: reach Helen's `ico_advisory` knot and choose to notify before the timer fires.

**Variable with no setter (known gap):**
- `ncsc_notified` — needs Ink choice in Hartley or Ravi dialogue

---

## KNOWN ISSUES TO LOG

- [ ] NSM SEVER bypasses dual_auth governance — player can isolate network without both PINs; `network_isolation_authorised` stays `false` as a detectable signal; engine `requiresGlobal` param needed on NSM
- [ ] SIEM `alertConfig: northgate_2025_11` is ignored — minigame uses hardcoded seeded alerts (which already match Northgate content); full config support is a P2 task
- [ ] Pharmacist NPC (`initiallyHidden:true` + `patrol.enabled:true`) — verify patrol does not run while hidden; should only activate on `setVisible:true` from `pharmacist_on_ward` eventMapping
- [ ] All NPC positions are first-pass estimates — verify against room tile renders before sign-off
- [ ] `debrief_complete` set in `npc_sharma.ink:closing` — verify Ink `~ debrief_complete = true` correctly propagates to engine globalVariables
