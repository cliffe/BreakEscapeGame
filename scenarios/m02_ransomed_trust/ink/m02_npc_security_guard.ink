// ===========================================
// PATROL NPC: Val Okonkwo -- Hospital Security Officer, nights
// Mission 2: Ransomed Trust
//
// Val works the security office -- a 2x2 room that the server room door opens
// off, so she is physically between the player and the only lock that matters.
// She has TWO completely different modes and the switch between them is the
// mission's midpoint:
//
//   BEFORE the cover burn -- the consultant line works. She's warm, funny,
//     slightly bored, and she'll wave you through on Kim's say-so.
//   AFTER the cover burn -- control has told her there is no consultant.
//     That line is now a lie she can disprove, and she is not stupid.
//     The player needs a real lanyard, Bernie vouching, or to earn it in
//     conversation. Or to put her on the floor, which has costs.
//
// She is not an obstacle for its own sake. She has independently clocked
// Graham Reeves and been told twice to drop it, which makes her the
// player's best alternative route into the insider thread if they treat
// her as a colleague rather than a turnstile.
//
// Physical combat is never scripted here -- aggression sets #hostile and
// hands control to the game's combat system.

Narrator: The security office sits between the main corridor and the server room, and the officer in it has clocked you through the glass before you are halfway across it.

Val Okonkwo: Alright. Stop there a sec.

Val Okonkwo: That door behind me is restricted, and before you say it -- yes, I know the readers are dead. That's precisely why it's me stood in front of it instead of them.

Val Okonkwo: So. Who are you and who says you're allowed?

=== cover_challenge ===
Narrator: She is not ambling any more. She crosses the office at a pace that closes the distance before you have decided what to do with it, and plants herself squarely between you and the server room door.

Val Okonkwo: Stay where you are.

Val Okonkwo: Control have just been on. There is no external consultant booked at this hospital tonight. There never was. Reception's paper log's been amended and there's nothing on the system, because there is no system.

Val Okonkwo: So whatever you told me an hour ago -- start again.

Narrator: She looks at you for a long moment. Somewhere behind you a generator changes note.

Val Okonkwo: Here's where I've got to. Either you're a wrong 'un with a stolen pass, or somebody's had my control room told a lie about you.

Val Okonkwo: And I've had this building tell me lies about who's supposed to be stood where for about six weeks now. So.

Narrator: She lowers the handset.

Val Okonkwo: She's named herself as vouching officer. In writing. On her own log, against her own staff number.

Val Okonkwo: Bernie Nwosu has worked that desk eleven years and has never once put her name to something she wasn't sure of. Not once.

Val Okonkwo: So now I've got a phone call from control saying one thing and Bernie saying the other, and I know which of those two I've actually met.

Val Okonkwo: Go on. Quick.

Val Okonkwo: And the fella who I reckon rang that in has never once stopped when I've asked.

Narrator: She steps aside, but not far.

Val Okonkwo: I'm putting my own name against this in my notebook. If you make a fool of me I'll find you myself.

Val Okonkwo: "Ask yourself who benefits" is what people say when they've got none of those.

Val Okonkwo: He is not on my rota. He has never been on my rota. I've asked Estates, I've asked control, I've asked the agency -- nobody's got a Graham Reeves on any list I'm allowed to see.
