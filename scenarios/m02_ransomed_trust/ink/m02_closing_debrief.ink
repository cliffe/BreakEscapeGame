Agent HaX: {player_name()}. Good to see you back on your feet. That's not nothing, after a night like that.

Agent HaX: Systems are back. Patients are stable. But I've read your field notes twice and I keep landing on the same thing.

Agent HaX: This wasn't a burglary. Ghost didn't want money -- they wanted a lesson taught in bodies. Casualties, calculated in advance, signed off before the operation ever started.

Agent HaX: We've seen that signature before. You've seen it before.

* [You mean Derek. Social Fabric.]

    Agent HaX: I mean Derek. Same fingerprints, different hands.

#speaker:agent_0x99
~ asked_about_the_call = true

Agent HaX: Yes. I've thought about very little else since your field notes came in.

Agent HaX: Eleven words on an internal telephone, and it very nearly cost you the operation. No exploit, no weapon, no confrontation. He simply removed the thing every one of your doors was actually running on, which was other people's willingness to believe you.

{insider_method_confirmed:
    Agent HaX: And ENTROPY's own handling notes had it written down as doctrine. "Do not obstruct physically. Remove their standing." They knew exactly what they were buying when they bought Reeves.
}

* [It worked because there was no system left to correct the record in.]
    Agent HaX: That's the part I want you to keep.
    Agent HaX: The ransomware didn't just take their patient records. It took their ability to know who anybody was. And the moment that goes, an institution runs entirely on social trust -- and social trust is a great deal easier to attack than a server.
    -> debrief_hub

* {bernie_vouched} [It didn't work. A night receptionist put her own staff number against my name.]
    Agent HaX: *and there's something almost like a laugh in it* Bernadette Nwosu.
    Agent HaX: Eleven years on a reception desk, no security clearance, no training, no idea who you actually were. And she is the single reason ENTROPY's inside asset did not run this operation to a conclusion.
    Agent HaX: Put her in the report by name. I'll make sure somebody senior enough to embarrass a hospital board reads it.
    -> debrief_hub

* {not cover_restored} [I never did get it back. I worked the rest of that night as a trespasser.]
    Agent HaX: I know. It's in every line of your notes.

    -> debrief_hub

=== q_ghost_identity ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

Agent HaX: Honestly? We don't know. "Ghost" is a handle, not a name.

Agent HaX: Fourteen months of preparation. A device planted during a fire drill six weeks before you ever arrived. Comms discipline so clean we've got nothing -- no face, no voice print, no trail out.

Agent HaX: What we do know is the shape of them. A true believer. Ransomware Incorporated's field operative, and they meant every word of it. To Ghost, the patients weren't victims. They were the argument.

{q_entropy_link > 0:
    Agent HaX: And that discipline? It's trained. Nobody's that careful by accident. Same school as Derek.
}

-> debrief_hub

=== q_entropy_link ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

Agent HaX: Yes. ENTROPY. The same network that ran Social Fabric out of Viral Dynamics.

Agent HaX: Derek Lawson kept casualty projections -- a spreadsheet of how many people Operation Shatter would kill, approved before he pulled the trigger. Ghost kept mortality calculations. Different cell, different weapon. Identical arithmetic.

Agent HaX: That's not coincidence. That's a method. Somebody taught both of them to do the math and sleep at night.

* [So the cells don't even know each other?]
    Agent HaX: Compartmentalised. Social Fabric never heard of Ransomware Incorporated. That's by design -- you can't burn a network you can't see.
    Agent HaX: But they all learned from the same source.
    -> debrief_hub
* [Then Derek was never the end of it.]
    Agent HaX: Derek was one node. Whatever happened to him at Viral Dynamics, the network kept moving. Ghost is proof.
    Agent HaX: We don't win this by catching operatives. We win it by finding the one who trains them.
    -> debrief_hub

=== q_architect ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

Agent HaX: The Architect. Derek's letter named them. Ghost's logs point the same way, without ever saying it.

Agent HaX: One person -- or one mind -- coordinating every cell. Social Fabric. Ransomware Incorporated. The two you haven't met yet.

Agent HaX: We don't have a name. We have a philosophy, a signature, and now two data points that rhyme. That's more than we had a week ago. Because of you.

}

{lore_ghosts_manifesto_found:
    Agent HaX: The manifesto -- read it again when you have time. It's how they see themselves. Understanding their ideology matters for what comes next.
}

{not flag_ghost_log_submitted and not lore_ghosts_manifesto_found:
    Agent HaX: The exploit chain was exactly what Ghost's communications suggested -- the ProFTPD 1.3.3c backdoor, fourteen years unpatched. Standard ENTROPY playbook.
}

{ghost_deal_accepted:
    Agent HaX: And you negotiated with Ghost. Got the keys without the ransom payment.

Agent HaX: 45 patients survived. The coroner's office ruled the deaths statistically probable regardless of the attack.

* [45 people are alive because we moved fast.]

#speaker:agent_0x99

Agent HaX: You ran the combined restore -- the keys off the backup server and the physical set out of the safe, together. Four hours. Systems back well inside the window.

Agent HaX: Patient outcomes: 2 fatalities -- both critical before the attack, both ruled statistically probable regardless. The wards held.

Agent HaX: And you paid ENTROPY nothing to get there. That is the closest thing to a clean result this night had in it. It cost you the legwork instead of costing them the win.

-> entropy_funding_discussion

=== manual_recovery_outcomes ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

Agent HaX: You went with the offline keys alone. Eleven hours, thirty-four minutes -- a full manual restore, right to the edge of the window.

Agent HaX: Patient outcomes: 6 fatalities. Ventilator complications, dialysis failures, cardiac arrests during the extended downtime.

{patient_bed4_deceased:
    Agent HaX: One of the six was the ventilated gentleman in Bed 4. Mr Pryce. His circuit went into alarm with no relay to carry it to the desk, and by the time a nurse got down the row it was over. You were in the building when it happened. I'm not putting that on you -- but you should know it was one of the ones a faster route home might have reached.
}
{bed4_manually_stabilised:
    Agent HaX: It would have been seven. The ventilated man in Bed 4 -- Mr Pryce -- went into a high-pressure alarm with nothing to carry it to the station, and you bagged him by hand until a nurse could take the bag off you. He is alive because you were standing there when the machine turned on him. Sister Doyle asked me to make sure that was written down.

Agent HaX: 6 people died during a crisis Ghost created. Not you.

Agent HaX: Medical review: 4 of the 6 had terminal diagnoses -- life expectancy under six months regardless. 2 were critical ICU patients, 50/50 odds even without the attack.

* [Ghost told me those deaths would be on my conscience.]
    Agent HaX: Ghost designed that line for maximum effect. They calculated patient death probabilities specifically to weaponise your empathy.
    Agent HaX: Don't let them win twice -- once with the attack, again with guilt.
    -> manual_recovery_vindication

* [I made the best decision I could]
    -> manual_recovery_vindication

=== manual_recovery_vindication ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

Agent HaX: You denied ENTROPY £87,000. No operational funding for Ransomware Incorporated.

Agent HaX: Ghost's next hospital target -- delayed. Possibly cancelled. And we have no transaction to trace, which means they have less financial signal to hide behind.

    Agent HaX: Gary Whitlock came round in an ambulance with a keycard gone and a fair idea of who took it. The man who'd been right about everything for two years -- and the night's answer was to put him down and step over him. He knows. He hasn't said. That is a debt, not an acquittal.
}

{gary_protected:
    Agent HaX: And Gary Whitlock has the thing he actually wanted, which was never his job. It was somebody senior saying, in writing, that he was right.

Agent HaX: Here's what I'll say, {player_name()}.

{player_cold:
    Agent HaX: When you walked in here, you named Derek before I could. Cold. Focused. That's useful in this work -- but I want you to hear the next part anyway.
}
{player_shaken:
    Agent HaX: You couldn't say the Architect's name out loud when you came in. Good. The day this stops costing you something is the day I start worrying about you.
}

{advised_board_refuse and paid_ransom:
    Agent HaX: One more thing. Dr. Kim held the board off because you told her you'd have the keys in time. In the end, someone wrote the cheque anyway. She spent trust she didn't have to spare -- on your word. People remember that.
}
{advised_board_pay and not paid_ransom:
    Agent HaX: For what it's worth -- you told Kim to pay, then found a way that didn't need paying. She'll have gone into that boardroom arguing for a cheque nobody had to write. A small thing. She noticed it anyway.
}
{advised_board_refuse and not paid_ransom:
    Agent HaX: And you kept your word to Kim. You told her you'd get the keys without paying, and you did. In this line of work, that's rarer than it should be. She knows what you spent to make good on it.
}
{advised_board_pay and paid_ransom:
    Agent HaX: You told Kim to pay, and that's how it ended. No surprises for her. She trusted your read, and your read held. That matters more than you'd think, next time you need someone on the inside to believe you.
}

Agent HaX: You faced a dilemma Ghost designed specifically to have no clean answer. Pay or don't pay -- both choices cost lives. Just different lives, different timeframes.

Agent HaX: You made a call under time pressure, with incomplete information, in a building full of people depending on you.

* [I made the best decision I could with what I had.]
    Agent HaX: That's all this job ever gives you. Best decision, available information, time pressure.
    Agent HaX: ENTROPY creates impossible dilemmas on purpose. They want you paralysed, or they want you to act and feel guilty either way.
    Agent HaX: You acted. That counts.
    -> mission_3_setup

* [I'm still not sure it was the right call.]
    {paid_ransom:
        Agent HaX: 45 people are alive today. That's real. Those are real families not burying someone.
        Agent HaX: ENTROPY has funding. That's also real. Both things are true simultaneously.
    - else:
        {ward_recovering:
            Agent HaX: You denied ENTROPY £87,000 and still had the wards back in four hours. Two died who were most likely going regardless. That is about as well as this ends.
        - else:
            Agent HaX: You denied ENTROPY £87,000. Long-term, that matters.
            Agent HaX: Six people died in the downtime. That also matters.
        }
    }
    Agent HaX: I won't tell you which weighs more. I genuinely don't know. Neither does anyone who hasn't stood where you stood.

#speaker:agent_0x99

Agent HaX: Zero Day Syndicate. They sold Ghost the ProFTPD exploit. They scanned 214 hospitals and recommended St. Catherine's specifically.

Agent HaX: Shut down their exploit marketplace and ENTROPY loses its technical supply chain across all cells.

Agent HaX: Operation Cyber Arsenal.

* [Let's take them down.]
    -> debrief_close

* [Ghost mentioned The Architect. Who coordinates ENTROPY?]

#speaker:agent_0x99

Agent HaX: The Architect runs the cells -- more of them than we've confirmed, and we don't know who they are yet.

Agent HaX: But each mission reveals more. Social Fabric, Ransomware Incorporated -- patterns emerging in how the cells communicate, how they're structured.

Agent HaX: Eventually we'll have enough to identify them. Then we end this.

Agent HaX: Get some rest, {player_name()}.

Agent HaX: You saved lives. You stopped an ENTROPY operation. You gathered intelligence on their network.

Agent HaX: That's what you came in there to do.

Agent HaX: We'll brief the next operation when you're ready.
