Agent HaX: {player_name()}. You're in. Good.

Agent HaX: Forty-seven on generators, twelve hours of fuel, and a board vote in four.

Agent HaX: Front desk first -- get yourself into their paper log, because the electronic one no longer exists. Then Dr. Kim. She's up on the main corridor, past the ward. She called us in.

+ [Understood]
    -> support_hub

+ [What should I know going in?]
    Agent HaX: One thing above everything else. Nobody in that building can grant you access to anything.
    Agent HaX: Their access control server is encrypted along with the rest of it. Kim can authorise you until she's hoarse and not a single reader will care.
    Agent HaX: So every door in there is a person, a mechanical key, or your picks. Plan around that and you'll be fine. Assume a badge will save you and you'll waste an hour.
    -> support_hub

+ [Anything I should be careful of?]
    Agent HaX: The institutional failure in there is going to make you angry. Gary Whitlock warned them seven times and got told to stop escalating. Feel it later.
    Agent HaX: And be careful who you are rude to. You are going to need at least one of those people to vouch for you before the night is out, and you will not know which one until it's too late to fix.

Agent HaX: Right. Deep breath. This is recoverable and it is not the first time.

Agent HaX: What you have lost is not access -- you never had any. What you have lost is the benefit of the doubt. Everything you have opened tonight, you opened because somebody chose to believe you.

Agent HaX: So go and get that back from somebody who has a reason to give it.

+ [Give me the options.]
    Agent HaX: Three, that I can see from here.
    Agent HaX: One. A real hospital lanyard. Gary in IT has a drawer of blank contractor passes, and the ward office keeps agency lanyards. Either will stand up in a corridor at four in the morning.
    Agent HaX: Two. Reception. If Bernie will log a correction under her own staff number, that beats an anonymous phone call, because control have actually met her.
    Agent HaX: Three. The officer in the security office. She is not an idiot and she has her own suspicions about somebody in that building. Give her a reason and she may make the call on her own judgement.
    -> support_hub

+ [And if none of them will help me?]
    Agent HaX: Then you go the long way round and you stay out of that corridor, and it costs you time you have not got.

    -> support_hub

=== cover_burned_who ===
#speaker:agent_0x99
~ insider_advice_given = true

Agent HaX: Somebody who knew exactly which lever to pull, is the honest answer.

Agent HaX: Think about what that call actually required. It required knowing you existed, knowing your booking was informal, knowing the access system was down so nobody could check, and knowing that hospital security would default to challenge rather than assume.

Agent HaX: That is not a hacker. Ghost is on the network, and if Ghost wanted you stopped they had cleaner ways. That is somebody standing in the building with a telephone and a working knowledge of the procedures.

{insider_evidence_partial:
    Agent HaX: And you have already found the thing that says an ENTROPY affiliate is embedded in that staff. So stop treating those as two separate problems, because they are not.
- else:
    Agent HaX: Which means when Ghost tells you they had help inside -- and they will -- take it seriously.
}

+ [So I'm looking for staff, not an intruder.]
    Agent HaX: You are looking for somebody with standing. Somebody a receptionist would let sign a book on her behalf.

Agent HaX: Ghost's watching the network. They've been on it since before you arrived.

Agent HaX: They know which rooms you've accessed. They may be able to suspend your SAFETYNET connection temporarily.

Agent HaX: Don't let that rattle you. They can't act against you directly. This is psychological pressure.

+ [Ghost seems to think they're justified]
    Agent HaX: They do. ENTROPY cells are ideological -- they've convinced themselves that calculated harm is acceptable if it changes the system.
    Agent HaX: Ghost isn't wrong about St. Catherine's negligence. That doesn't make their methods right.
    Agent HaX: Their logic is their problem. Your job is those 47 patients.
    -> support_hub

+ [Ghost cut my SAFETYNET connection briefly]
    Agent HaX: Noted. Network-level access. We knew they had it.

Agent HaX: You made a deal with Ghost.

Agent HaX: In exchange: you publish the board's negligence from the press terminal.

#speaker:narrator
Narrator: A pause.

#speaker:agent_0x99
Agent HaX: Ghost gets exactly what they wanted without spending £87,000.

Agent HaX: You're still the one making the final choice at that terminal. Ghost's deal doesn't override your judgment.

+ [Is it wrong to have taken it?]
    Agent HaX: I don't know. You took resources from a terrorist to save lives and deny them funding simultaneously.
    Agent HaX: The ethics depend entirely on what you do at the press terminal. Don't let Ghost own that decision.

=== board_email_reaction ===
#speaker:agent_0x99
~ board_email_discussed = true

Agent HaX: The board was planning to terminate Gary and bury his warnings before anyone asked questions.

Agent HaX: That's not negligence anymore. That's deliberate cover-up of the conditions that created this crisis.

Agent HaX: That email is going to matter at the press terminal. Keep it in mind.

+ [This changes how I see the exposure decision]
    Agent HaX: It should. Publishing just the budget decisions is one thing. Publishing the cover-up is another.
    Agent HaX: The hospital made two distinct failures. You'll decide which gets the full public record.
    -> support_hub

=== hint_start ===
#speaker:agent_0x99
~ hint_start_given = true

Agent HaX: Front desk, then west.

Agent HaX: The night coordinator on reception is holding every mechanical override key in that building on a hook behind her, because Estates dumped them on her this morning. That includes IT. She is the first lock in this mission and she is a person, not a door.

Agent HaX: Then Dr. Kim, the CTO. She called us in and she is out of options, which makes her useful and slightly unpredictable.

+ [What about Gary Whitlock?]
    Agent HaX: IT administrator. Main corridor, far door, behind that override lock.
    Agent HaX: He warned them about this exact vulnerability seven times and got told to stop escalating. He is furious, guilty and holding the only working credential in the building.
    Agent HaX: Desk first, Kim second, Gary third. The order buys you goodwill you will want later.
    -> support_hub

+ [Understood]
    -> support_hub

=== hint_lockpick ===
#speaker:agent_0x99
~ hint_lockpick_given = true

Agent HaX: The server room is the one door in that hospital where picks and charm are both useless.

Agent HaX: RFID, on a standalone offline controller -- which is why it still works when nothing else does. It will only accept a card that already exists, and no new card can be issued, because the thing that issues them is encrypted.

Agent HaX: Gary has one. That is the entire route. Get it from him, or take it off him, but you are not getting past that reader any other way.

+ [And the IT department door itself?]
    Agent HaX: Standard pin tumbler on a mechanical override. Reception has the key, and your picks will do it if she won't.
    Agent HaX: One warning -- her desk faces that door. Picking a lock she has already offered you the key to is not a clever look.
    -> support_hub

+ [What if Gary won't play?]
    Agent HaX: Then give him a reason. He has a locked filing cabinet in there full of the warnings nobody read.
    Agent HaX: Put one of those in front of him and you stop being another person who wants something from him.
    -> support_hub

+ [Got it]
    -> support_hub

=== hint_password ===
#speaker:agent_0x99
~ hint_password_given = true

Agent HaX: Gary has spent six months being treated as an overhead. Don't be the fifth person tonight to walk in and treat him as one.

Agent HaX: He does not want sympathy, he wants somebody to acknowledge he was right in writing. Give him that and he'll open every drawer he owns.

Agent HaX: And do not, whatever you do, ask him how he let this happen. He will hand you the card and stop being any further use to you at all.

+ [What am I actually after from him?]
    Agent HaX: The server room card, and the credentials on the backup box. Shared admin login, never rotated -- Emma2018, Hospital1987, StCatherines.
    Agent HaX: He'll tell you if he trusts you. If he doesn't, it's on a sticky note stuck to his monitor, which tells you everything about the state of that department.

=== hint_vm ===

Agent HaX: The ProFTPD 1.3.3c backdoor. Remote code execution via a backdoor planted in the source code itself.

Agent HaX: A clean release shipped days later, back in 2010. St. Catherine's is still running the poisoned build. Your target.

Agent HaX: The exploit gets you root on the backup server. From there, navigate the filesystem for encrypted database backups.

+ [What's the full exploit chain?]
    Agent HaX: SSH access to confirm the server's reachable. ProFTPD exploit for root. Then filesystem navigation to the database backups.

Agent HaX: Field note's on your terminal.

Agent HaX: Clamp the cracker on and read the lights. Greens are the right digit in the right slot; ambers are the right digit in the wrong slot. Each guess you make, the pattern of lights rules out combinations -- four or five rows and the code has nowhere left to hide.

Agent HaX: And take the lesson wider than one safe. Any system that tells an attacker how close they got is leaking. Build them so a wrong answer says nothing but "wrong".

    -> support_hub

=== hint_encoding ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

Agent HaX: Encoding is not encryption. Important distinction.

Agent HaX: Encoding -- Base64, ROT13, hex -- transforms data for storage or transit. No secret key. Reversible by anyone with the right tool.

Agent HaX: Encryption requires a key. Without it, the data is meaningless.

Agent HaX: ENTROPY uses encoding for obfuscation and encryption for actual security. When you find something encoded, use CyberChef.

+ [How do I use CyberChef for Base64?]
    Agent HaX: Workstation in the server room. Open CyberChef, drag "From Base64" into the recipe, paste your text. Instant decode.
    Agent HaX: For ROT13, same process -- drag the ROT13 operation in.

Agent HaX: Ghost's logs confirmed offline backup keys are in a physical PIN safe. Emergency equipment store, far end of the ward.

Agent HaX: Four-digit code. Hospitals use institutional dates -- founding years, significant administrative anniversaries.

Agent HaX: The answer's somewhere in the building. Check plaques, framed documents, administrative notices.

+ [I've already found a clue]
    Agent HaX: Trust it. Hospitals are consistent about this kind of thing.
    -> support_hub

+ [What if I can't find the PIN?]
    Agent HaX: Then you go in the noisy way. There's a sealed case in that storage room -- not hospital kit, no key for it in the building. Pick the latch; your picks will do it. Whoever left it there wanted that safe as badly as you do.

=== hint_ransom_decision ===

Agent HaX: You have both key types. That means independent recovery is genuinely on the table.

Agent HaX: Pay the ransom: 1-2 patient deaths, £87,000 funds ENTROPY's next operation.

Agent HaX: Manual recovery: 4-6 patient deaths, ENTROPY gets nothing. The hospital recovers independently.

Agent HaX: Both choices save lives -- different timeframes, different costs. That's what makes it hard.

+ [What would you choose?]
    Agent HaX: I'm not going to answer that.
    Agent HaX: What I'll say: don't let Ghost's framing decide it for you. They designed this dilemma. Don't let them own your answer.

    {ghost_contacted_player:
        Agent HaX: Ghost may have offered one. Free keys in exchange for publishing the evidence.

        Agent HaX: It's your call whether to engage with that.

#speaker:agent_0x99

Agent HaX: If Ghost's keys are legitimate, that's your fastest path.

Agent HaX: No ransom paid. No ENTROPY funding. Recovery in under an hour.

Agent HaX: The cost is the agreement: publish the evidence at the press terminal.

Agent HaX: Make sure you understand what you're agreeing to before you initiate recovery.

Agent HaX: You've read Ghost's calculations. They projected deaths before the operation started and proceeded anyway.

Agent HaX: This is what ENTROPY looks like across every cell we've uncovered. Not opportunistic criminals. True believers with risk models.

+ [How do you fight that?]
    Agent HaX: Evidence and consequences, long term.
    Agent HaX: True believers lose credibility when their predicted outcomes don't materialize.
    Agent HaX: If hospitals sector-wide improve security after this -- and attacks drop -- Ghost's ideology loses its proof of concept.
    Agent HaX: Frustrating timeline. But that's what works against ideological movements.
    -> support_hub

+ [Ghost's diagnosis is hard to argue with]
    Agent HaX: I know. Institutional negligence is real. The board's decisions were genuinely bad.
    Agent HaX: The question isn't whether the diagnosis is accurate. It's whether calculating deaths as acceptable costs and proceeding anyway is a line you can cross and still be the good guys.
    Agent HaX: Ghost crossed it. That's why we're here.

Agent HaX: Transmit and it's public record within the hour. Don't transmit and it stays internal.

Agent HaX: That's the last decision of this mission.

+ [What's the right choice here?]
    Agent HaX: Public exposure forces sector-wide change. Forty-three other hospitals on ENTROPY's reconnaissance list might patch before someone teaches them the same lesson.
    Agent HaX: Quiet resolution protects St. Catherine's. Gary's vindication stays an internal matter.
    Agent HaX: I'm not going to tell you which is right.

    Agent HaX: Then you know what you need to do. The question is whether you're honouring it.

    Agent HaX: Gary is your route to the server room, and cooperation gets you three things where theft only gets you one.

{flag_ssh_submitted and not offline_keys_recovered:
    Agent HaX: Two tracks in the server room: VM exploitation for digital keys, and the physical safe for offline keys.
    Agent HaX: You want both for independent recovery.
