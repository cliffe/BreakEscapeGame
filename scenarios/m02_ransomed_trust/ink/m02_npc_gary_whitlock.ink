// ===========================================
// ACT 2 NPC: Gary Whitlock -- IT Systems Administrator
// Mission 2: Ransomed Trust
//
// Gary holds the only credential in the building that still opens anything:
// the server room card, on an isolated reader that survived the encryption.
// He is therefore the mission's hard gate -- which means he must NEVER be a
// dead end. Four routes to the card:
//
//   RAPPORT   -- treat him as a professional who was right. He hands it over,
//                plus the spare contractor lanyard and the credentials.
//   LEVERAGE  -- pick his filing cabinet first and put his own seventh warning
//                on the desk in front of him. Recovers him from ANY state,
//                including hostile. Rewards the player who explored.
//   TRANSACTION -- be cold about it. He gives you the card and nothing else.
//   FORCE     -- KO him; itemsHeld drops both card and lanyard. taskOnKO
//                covers talk_to_gary, the handler covers the credentials.
//
// So the "wrong" opening costs the player the lanyard, the credentials from
// his mouth, and his good opinion. It never costs them the mission -- the
// sticky note on his monitor carries the credentials regardless.

Narrator: Two dead terminals, a cold mug with a skin on it, and squared up on the desk beside the keyboard, printed out, a stack of his own emails.

Gary Whitlock: *not turning round* If you're the bloke from head office, the answer's still no, I can't "just restore from backup", because the backup is the bit they encrypted.

Gary Whitlock: If you're the police, I've told your mate everything twice.

Gary Whitlock: You've read them.

Gary Whitlock: *carefully, like he's testing a stair* Nobody's read them. Not properly. Kim read the first one. Somebody in Finance read the one with the number in it. After that it was "noted" and "noted" and "noted".

Gary Whitlock: I got so I was writing them for the archive. Not to be actioned. Just so that one day somebody could find them and see I'd said it.

Gary Whitlock: Bit pathetic when you say it out loud.

Narrator: He swivels the chair round.

Gary Whitlock: Finally. Someone who wants the technical version.

Gary Whitlock: Backup server. ProFTPD -- the poisoned one, one point three point three c. Somebody trojaned the actual source release back in 2010 and it shipped with a backdoor built in. It's been public and patchable since. Fourteen years.

Gary Whitlock: Whoever did this didn't have to be clever. They had to be awake and have a scanner.

Gary Whitlock: That box is where every clinical backup we own lives. That's the whole disaster, in one sentence, and I put that sentence in an email in May.

+ [Fourteen years unpatched on the box that holds every backup. That's not your failure, that's a funding decision.]

Narrator: He goes very still.

Gary Whitlock: My estate.

Gary Whitlock: I costed the fix in May. Eighty-five thousand pounds. I sent it seven times. I was told to stop escalating it outside the department, in writing, by the Chief Technology Officer, and I have that email in my hand right now.

Gary Whitlock: Then they signed off three point two million on a scanner.

Narrator: He picks the keycard off the desk and puts it down again in front of you, hard enough that it skids.

Gary Whitlock: Server room. Take it. That's what you came for.

Gary Whitlock: And when they write this up and it says the administrator failed to maintain his estate -- you'll know. You'll have known and said nothing. Same as the rest of them.

Narrator: He pulls a lanyard out from under his collar and looks at it.

Gary Whitlock: You'll have found every reader in the building dead on your way to me. So you already know the interesting bit is what's still alive.

Gary Whitlock: This one. Server room reader's on its own controller -- isolated, no network, nothing on it worth encrypting. I argued for that in 2019 and I actually won, for once in my life. Turns out being right about one thing buys you exactly one working door.

Gary Whitlock: So this card's the only credential in St Catherine's that opens anything at all tonight. And no, before you ask, nobody can cut you your own -- the machine that issues them went in the fire with the rest.

Narrator: He pulls a folded sticky note off the monitor bezel and flattens it out.

Gary Whitlock: Shared admin credential on the backup box. Never rotated. I know. I KNOW. It's on the list, and the list is four years long, and the list is why we're here.

Gary Whitlock: So I thought: at least when they come for me, it'll be on paper.

Gary Whitlock: So I did it six more times anyway, because what else are you going to do.
