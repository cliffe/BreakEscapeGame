// ===========================================
// ACT 1/2 NPC: Dr. Sarah Kim -- Chief Technology Officer
// Mission 2: Ransomed Trust
//
// Kim is the person who called you in and the person who caused this, and she
// knows both of those things at the same time. She is the mission's exposition
// engine for the central premise -- SHE CANNOT AUTHORISE ANYTHING, because the
// system that grants authorisation is behind the ransom screen. That is the
// line that makes the whole mission make sense, and it comes from her.
//
// She gives: the boardroom code, the pointer to Marcus, a countersigned paper
// badge that opens nothing, and the fire-drill seed (she never approved it).
//
// Her big consequence choice is the board vote. advised_board_pay /
// advised_board_refuse are read back in the closing debrief against what the
// player ACTUALLY did at the recovery console. Telling her to hold the line
// and then paying anyway is a specific, remembered betrayal.

Narrator: Dr. Sarah Kim is standing at the window with a mobile in each hand. She has been up since three and it shows in a way that expensive tailoring cannot do anything about.

Dr. Sarah Kim: You're the consultant.

Dr. Sarah Kim: I'm going to say three things very quickly, because I am waiting on a board call that has been rescheduled twice and will land the moment I stop expecting it.

Dr. Sarah Kim: Forty-seven patients on generators. Twelve hours of fuel. And the board votes on paying these people in four.

* [Then let's not waste any of it. Tell me how they got in.]

* [You called us in. That took nerve, given what the vote's going to cost you.]
    ~ kim_influence += 10
    # influence_increased
    Dr. Sarah Kim: *a short, unamused breath* Nerve. That's a generous word for it.
    Dr. Sarah Kim: I called you in because I had already decided who was to blame and I wanted somebody in the building who wasn't me.
    ~ kim_guilt_revealed = true
    -> explain_attack

* [Four things. You've missed one. What do you actually need from me?]
    ~ kim_influence += 8
    # influence_increased
    Dr. Sarah Kim: *pause* Yes. All right.
    Dr. Sarah Kim: I need an alternative. Any alternative. I cannot walk into that room with nothing but a Bitcoin address.

// ===========================================
// HOW THEY GOT IN
// ===========================================

=== explain_attack ===
~ topic_attack_vector = true

Dr. Sarah Kim: The backup server. There is a flaw in the file transfer software on it -- old, publicly documented, patchable for years.

Dr. Sarah Kim: I am not going to pretend I understand the technical detail. That is Marcus Webb's world and he has been trying to explain it to me since May.

Dr. Sarah Kim: What I understood was the figure next to it. Eighty-five thousand pounds.

* [And you deferred it.]
    ~ kim_guilt_revealed = true
    -> the_deferral

* [What did you spend it on instead?]
    ~ kim_guilt_revealed = true

* [Understood. Where's Marcus now?]
    ~ topic_marcus = true
    -> discuss_marcus

=== the_deferral ===
~ kim_guilt_revealed = true

Dr. Sarah Kim: A replacement scanner. Three point two million.

Dr. Sarah Kim: And before you say it -- yes, I can defend that decision. I can defend it very well. I have defended it in front of a commissioning board with a slide deck. Imaging capacity against infrastructure that has never once failed.

Narrator: She stops. Looks at the dead screen on her desk.

Dr. Sarah Kim: It has never once failed. That was the actual sentence. I said it out loud in March.

* [You made a clinical trade-off with the information you had. That's the job.]
    ~ kim_influence += 8
    # influence_increased
    Dr. Sarah Kim: I had the information. That's rather the difficulty. It was in my inbox seven times.
    -> access_problem

* [You had a written warning from your own administrator. Seven of them.]
    ~ kim_influence -= 5
    # influence_decreased
    Dr. Sarah Kim: *evenly* I know exactly how many there were. I replied to all of them.
    Dr. Sarah Kim: I would rather you were the one saying that to me than a coroner. Get on with your job.
    -> access_problem

* [Save it for the inquiry. Right now I need doors.]
    ~ kim_influence += 5
    # influence_increased
    Dr. Sarah Kim: *almost relieved* Thank you. Yes. Doors.

=== access_problem ===
~ access_explained = true
#complete_task:meet_dr_kim
#unlock_aim:access_it_systems
#give_item:id_badge

Dr. Sarah Kim: Now. This is where I have to disappoint you, and I want to be precise about it, because everyone I have said this to tonight has assumed I am being obstructive.

Dr. Sarah Kim: I am the Chief Technology Officer of this hospital and I cannot grant you access to a single room in it.

* [Because?]
    -> access_because

* [Your badge system is encrypted along with everything else.]
    ~ kim_influence += 10
    # influence_increased
    Narrator: For the first time she looks at you with something like interest.

    Dr. Sarah Kim: Thank you. Yes.
    -> access_because

=== access_because ===
Dr. Sarah Kim: Access control runs on the same estate as everything else. Every permission, every card mapping, every door group. All of it is sat behind that ransom screen.

Dr. Sarah Kim: So I can authorise you verbally until I lose my voice and it will not open one door, because there is nothing left that can be told about it.

Narrator: She signs your paper badge, writes an extension number on it, and hands it back.

Dr. Sarah Kim: That is genuinely the extent of my power tonight. A signature on a piece of card.

Dr. Sarah Kim: Everything mechanical, Estates dumped on reception this morning -- back down through the ward, if you have not come that way. Bernie has the override keys on a hook and rather more authority than her job title suggests. Be nice to her.

Dr. Sarah Kim: And the server room -- I cannot help you at all. That reader is on its own isolated controller, which is the one thing in this building that Marcus won an argument about, and it will only take a card that already exists. He has one. I do not.

+ [So my route is Marcus.]
    Dr. Sarah Kim: Your route is Marcus.
    Dr. Sarah Kim: Far end of this corridor, behind the override lock. He has been in there since half past ten and I have not had the courage to walk down and knock.

~ topic_marcus = true

Dr. Sarah Kim: Marcus is the best administrator this hospital has and I have spent six months teaching him that being right is worthless here.

Dr. Sarah Kim: He is going to be sacked. Not by me -- I do not think I get to make that decision any more -- but he is going to be sacked, and the paperwork will say something about implementation failure.

Dr. Sarah Kim: And the thing that will finish me, when I am old, is that he will believe it was my idea.

+ [Was it?]
    Dr. Sarah Kim: *pause* No.
    Dr. Sarah Kim: But I deferred his budget, I told him to stop escalating, and I have not been down that corridor once tonight. At some point the difference stops mattering.

Dr. Sarah Kim: You want it in writing.

Narrator: She does not argue. She writes for about thirty seconds, signs it, and holds it out without reading it back.

Dr. Sarah Kim: Statement of fact. The security remediation was costed, escalated seven times, and deferred on my recommendation. Not his.

Dr. Sarah Kim: If they want a name on this, they can have the correct one.

Narrator: You describe the email. Board chair to Legal. Reframe as implementation failure. Termination paperwork. Non-disparagement agreement.

Narrator: Kim reads the room's dead screens for a while before she answers.

Dr. Sarah Kim: Non-disparagement.

Dr. Sarah Kim: So they have not only decided it was him. They have decided he is not to be allowed to say otherwise.

Narrator: She sets both phones down.

Dr. Sarah Kim: Right.

Dr. Sarah Kim: Whatever happens on this vote, that does not happen. You have my statement, you have his emails, and if it comes to it you have me in a committee room saying it out loud.

Dr. Sarah Kim: *frowning* Six weeks ago.

Dr. Sarah Kim: There was a drill. Half past two in the morning, no notice. I remember because I was rung at home about it, and because Estates spent the following week furious.

Dr. Sarah Kim: Furious because they had not scheduled it. Nobody had scheduled it. There is no drill on the annual plan for that night and there is no record of one being requested.

Dr. Sarah Kim: We put it down to a fault on the panel and moved on. We had a scanner to install.

* [Somebody walked contractors through this building that night under cover of a drill nobody called.]
    ~ kim_influence += 5

Dr. Sarah Kim: Eighty-seven thousand pounds. Against forty-seven people on generators and a hospital that cannot tell you what anyone is allergic to.

Dr. Sarah Kim: Six of the nine will vote to pay. They are not monsters. They are frightened people who have been told a number and a timescale by somebody very good at presenting both.

Dr. Sarah Kim: And they are right, in the narrow sense. Paying is faster. Faster is fewer funerals tonight.

Dr. Sarah Kim: It also puts eighty-seven thousand pounds into the hands of the people who did this, so that they can do it to somebody else in about a month.

Dr. Sarah Kim: They dial in the moment they've finished arguing among themselves. What do I tell them?

Dr. Sarah Kim: I authorised you. I countersigned your badge an hour ago. I have not spoken to security control all night.

Narrator: She reaches for a phone, stops, and puts it down again with visible frustration.

Dr. Sarah Kim: And I cannot fix it, can I. Because there is no system left to correct the record in. That is exactly why it worked.

Dr. Sarah Kim: Somebody in this building understood that before you did, and before I did.
