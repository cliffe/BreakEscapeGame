## Cross-File Verification

### Files Checked:
1. ✅ `scenario.json.erb` (lines 41-183) - **5 objectives, 15 tasks**
2. ✅ `SOLUTION_GUIDE.md` (lines 55-183) - **5 objectives, 15 tasks documented**
3. ✅ Ink dialogue scripts reference task completion via `#complete_task` tags
4. ✅ Global variables track objective states

### Consistency Verification:

| Aspect | scenario.json.erb | SOLUTION_GUIDE.md | Status |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Objective Count** | 5 | 5 | ✅ Match |
| **Task Count** | 15 | 15 | ✅ Match |
| **Objective IDs** | infiltrate_hospital, access_it_systems, exploit_entropy_backdoor, recover_offline_keys, make_critical_decisions | Same | ✅ Match |
| **Task IDs** | arrive_at_hospital, meet_dr_kim, talk_to_marcus, obtain_password_hints, decode_ransomware_note, access_server_room, submit_ssh_flag, submit_proftpd_flag, submit_database_flag, submit_ghost_log_flag, locate_safe, gather_pin_clues, crack_safe_pin, make_ransom_decision, decide_hospital_exposure | Same | ✅ Match |

## Progression Flow

### Linear Progression:
```
Start → Objective 1 (Active)
     ↓
Objective 1 Complete → Unlock Objective 2
     ↓
Objective 2 (Access Server Room) → Unlock Objective 3
     ↓
Objective 3 (Submit Flags) → Unlock Objective 4
     ↓
Objective 3 + 4 Both Complete → Unlock Objective 5
     ↓
Objective 5 Complete → Mission Complete
```

### Task Dependencies:
- **Objective 1:** Linear (1 → 2 → 3)
- **Objective 2:** Can be completed in any order, but access_server_room gates Objective 3
- **Objective 3:** 4 flags can be submitted in any order (SSH → ProFTPD → Database → Ghost Log recommended)
- **Objective 4:** Linear (1 → 2 → 3)
- **Objective 5:** Both decisions required, order flexible

---

## Clarity Assessment

### ✅ Objectives are CLEAR:
- Each objective has a descriptive title
- Each objective has a clear description of purpose
- Each task has specific completion criteria
- Task types are well-defined (enter_room, npc_conversation, collect_items, submit_flags, unlock_object, custom)
- Target rooms, NPCs, items, and objects are explicitly named
- Multiple solution paths documented (keycard vs lockpicking, social vs investigation)

### ✅ Objectives are CONSTANT:
- Objectives defined once in `scenario.json.erb`
- Same 5 objectives, same 15 tasks across all documentation
- No conflicting task lists
- No ambiguous completion criteria
- Progressive unlock structure ensures consistent player experience
- Global variables track persistent state

3. 🔒 **Objective 3: Exploit ENTROPY's Backdoor** (Unlocks after server room access)
4. 🔒 **Objective 4: Recover Offline Backup Keys** (Unlocks after database flag)
5. 🔒 **Objective 5: Make Critical Decisions** (Unlocks after Objectives 3 & 4)

### Task Visibility:
- Active tasks shown with ✅ checkmark when complete
- Locked tasks shown with 🔒 until unlocked
- Progressive unlocking prevents confusion
- Clear task titles guide player actions
