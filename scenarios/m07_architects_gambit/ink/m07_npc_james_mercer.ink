#complete_task:confront_mercer

Narrator: The control room is warm and very quiet. One man at the master console, jacket over the back of the chair, sleeves turned back. He is typing without hurry.

Narrator: He does not stop when the door opens.

Dr. James Mercer: You're early. *still typing* Not by much.

Narrator: He finishes the line he is on, presses return, and only then turns round.

Dr. James Mercer: James Mercer. I'd offer a hand but you'd only refuse it, and then we'd both be embarrassed.

{countdown_expired:
    Dr. James Mercer: You'll have noticed the schedule has passed its mark. That isn't a failure on your part. It was never going to wait for the conversation.
}

Dr. James Mercer: Sit if you like. You've walked a long way through my building.

    Dr. James Mercer: The other thing is when they try to tell me I don't really mean it. That underneath I'm frightened, or sorry, or looking for a way out. It's very insulting and it wastes what little time there is.

    Dr. James Mercer: All right. That's a technique, and it's a decent one, and it won't work on me, but I'll take the invitation.

=== topic_lesson ===
~ heard_the_lesson = true

Dr. James Mercer: I did publish. Four papers, two of them still cited. I testified twice. I filed the same submission three times across eight years and watched it costed, deferred and declined by people who could not have told you what a phase angle was.

Dr. James Mercer: In 2019 a coronal event came within about ninety minutes of taking the western interconnect down on its own. Nobody wrote about it. Nothing changed. The system does not respond to argument. It responds to consequence.

Dr. James Mercer: So I stopped arguing.

Narrator: He says it the way a lecturer arrives at the obvious step, and waits to see whether the room has kept up.

+ [That is a very long way to walk to reach murder.]
    Dr. James Mercer: It's a very long way to walk to reach anything. That's rather the point about the length of it.
    -> hub
+ [You wanted to be right more than you wanted to be listened to.]
    Dr. James Mercer: *considers this properly* No. I wanted to be listened to for eight years. Being right was what I had left.
    -> hub

=== topic_numbers ===
~ heard_the_numbers = true

Dr. James Mercer: Two hundred and forty at the low end. Three hundred and eighty-five at the high.

Narrator: He does not have to look it up.

Dr. James Mercer: A hundred and twenty to a hundred and eighty in hospitals, from generator failures and from response times that stretch past what a heart will tolerate. Forty to sixty-five on the roads, in the dark, at junctions with no signals. Eighty to a hundred and forty from cold, in flats where the elderly do not have a second way to stay warm.

Dr. James Mercer: Water treatment fails at forty-eight hours. Restoration is four to seven days, because a transformer of that class is not a stock item and never has been. Which is itself the finding.

+ [You memorised them.]
    Dr. James Mercer: I wrote them. It would be a strange sort of cowardice to write them and then decline to know them.
    -> hub
+ [And you are going to do it anyway.]
    Dr. James Mercer: Yes.
    Narrator: No pause before it. No weight on it. The single most ordinary word he has said.

{elena_outcome == "turned":
    Dr. James Mercer: She's told you, then. *mild* I did wonder which way she'd go once somebody put a kind voice on it.
- else:
    Dr. James Mercer: Elena. *a small nod* Yes.
}

Dr. James Mercer: She was given the outage model and the restoration curve. Both accurate. She was not given the human-cost annex, because she would have refused, and I needed a substation engineer, not a conscience.

+ [You lied to her.]
    Dr. James Mercer: I withheld from her. She'd say lied. On the balance of it I'd let her have the word.
    Dr. James Mercer: If it helps you: I don't think worse of her for it. She simply isn't able to carry the number. Most people aren't. That is why most people don't get to decide.
    -> hub
+ [She thought nobody would be hurt. You let her believe that.]
    Dr. James Mercer: She thought it because I arranged the documents so she could. Yes.
    Narrator: He turns back to the console for a moment, checks something, turns back.
    Dr. James Mercer: You'll want to make that an accusation. Make it. It's accurate.
    -> hub

=== topic_the_page ===
~ showed_him_the_page = true

Narrator: You put the projection down on the console beside his hand. His own signature, his own date, his own handwriting along the foot of the page.

Narrator: He picks it up. He reads it the way a man rereads something he wrote, checking whether it still holds.

Dr. James Mercer: "Twice now the warnings have been costed and declined. This is the third submission. It will be read."

Dr. James Mercer: *sets it down carefully* I was rather pleased with that line. It's still true.

Narrator: There is no flinch in him anywhere. He signed it because signing it was the honest thing to do, and he would like that noted.

Dr. James Mercer: You brought it here to make me look at it. I've looked at it more than you have. I costed the hypothermia column myself because the modeller kept rounding down and I thought that was dishonest.

+ [Then you'll say that in a room with a stenographer in it.]
    Dr. James Mercer: *slowly* Now that is an interesting offer.
    -> hub
+ [You are not a teacher. You are a man with a spreadsheet of the dead.]

#set_global:mercer_told_diversion:true

You: Fracture, Trojan Horse, Meltdown, and you. One schedule, one authority, one clock. It came off a share in your own server room.

Dr. James Mercer: I'm aware there are other operations.

You: You're not aware of what they're for. Three of them are loud and none of them are meant to succeed. They're for occupying us. So is this one. You're the biggest and the noisiest of the four, doctor. That's the whole of your function tonight.

Narrator: He starts to answer. Stops.

Narrator: He turns to the console and pulls the coordination window himself, because of course he has the access, and reads it. It takes him about twenty seconds.

Dr. James Mercer: *very evenly* This is a scheduling artefact. Cells share infrastructure. It doesn't follow.

Narrator: He reads it again anyway. His hand stays on the desk longer than it needs to.

Dr. James Mercer: The lesson stands whether or not somebody else found it convenient. The grid is still fragile. The number is still the number.

Narrator: He is saying it correctly and he is saying it to himself.

+ [It stands. It just isn't yours. You were the noise.]
    Dr. James Mercer: *after a moment* Then he chose well. I'd have been very hard to use for anything small.
    -> hub
+ [He needed somebody who'd sign the page. That's all you were for.]
    Narrator: Mercer looks at the countdown for a while without saying anything.
    Dr. James Mercer: I'd like you to know that I would have done it regardless.
    Narrator: Which is true, and is also the first thing he has said tonight that he needed you to believe.

Dr. James Mercer: End it how? *spreads his hands* The sequence is local. It doesn't take an abort from this chair, it doesn't phone anyone, and it doesn't care what happens to me in the next four minutes. I built it that way so I couldn't be leaned on.

Dr. James Mercer: You don't need me. That's the part everyone gets wrong. You need the host in the next room.

=== ending_record ===
~ mercer_fate = "arrested"
#set_global:mercer_fate:arrested

You: You signed it. You costed the hypothermia column because rounding down felt dishonest to you. You're going to say that in a deposition, under your own name, with the page in front of you.

Narrator: For the first time all evening he looks at you as though you have said something he did not expect.

Dr. James Mercer: You'd let me speak.

You: I'd let you be quoted. There's a difference and you'll find out what it is.

Narrator: He thinks about it for perhaps three seconds. Then he unclips his facility badge, sets it on the console, and puts his hands where you can see them.

Dr. James Mercer: All right. On the record.

Dr. James Mercer: You should understand that I'm agreeing because it's a better outcome for me than the alternative, and not because you've moved me. Nothing you've said has moved me. I want that on the record too.

Narrator: SAFETYNET tactical come through the door forty seconds later. He does not resist and does not stop talking, and by the time they have him in the stairwell he is explaining transformer lead times to a man who did not ask.

Narrator: He sits down. Not in surrender. More as though standing had become a thing that required a reason.

Dr. James Mercer: The sequence still runs. I want you to be clear that I haven't stopped it and wouldn't.

You: I know.

Narrator: He turns the chair a few degrees towards the coordination window, still open on the screen, and looks at it again.

Dr. James Mercer: Twenty years. Four papers. Three submissions. *quietly* And a scheduling slot.

Narrator: He does not crumble. He is far too well built for that. But something goes out of the room with him still in it, and when tactical arrive he stands up before they ask him to.

Dr. James Mercer: The grid is still fragile.

Narrator: He says it to nobody in particular, on the way out, the way a man checks that he still has his keys.

You: Away from the console. Hands where I can see them. I won't ask again.

Narrator: He stands. He is fifty-eight and he is not quick, and he moves towards you anyway, which tells you what the next few seconds are.

Dr. James Mercer: You've come a very long way to be one more person who won't listen.

Narrator: The console is behind him. It stays behind him. Whatever happens in this room, the sequence is still running on a host in the next one, and that is still where you have to go.

You: Go on. Out. You're not the emergency and I'm not going to pretend you are.

Narrator: That lands harder than anything else you have said to him.

Dr. James Mercer: *stops* I'm sorry?

You: The host is next door. The scripts are next door. You're a man in a room with a signed piece of paper. Leave.

Narrator: He collects his jacket from the back of the chair. He is careful about the sleeves. At the door he stops, because he cannot quite help it.

Dr. James Mercer: When the third submission is declined, agent, somebody does this. It doesn't have to be me. It never had to be me.

Narrator: Then he is gone down the service stair, and the countdown carries on without him, which was always the arrangement.
