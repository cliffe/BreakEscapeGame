{player_name()}, report. What's the status?

* [Attack prevented. Emergency shutdown engaged, banks isolated.]
    -> debrief_attack_stopped

* [Attack fully prevented. Voltage has been {voltage_captured: captured | neutralized. He escaped.}]
    -> debrief_voltage_status

=== debrief_attack_stopped ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

Good work. Thermal runaway aborted, the banks are isolated, systems secured.

{chen_trust_level >= 70 and not robert_vance_ko:
    Vance speaks highly of your work. Says you saved 240,000 lives.
}
{robert_vance_ko:
    The facility manager's being treated by medics. He'll live. He won't be filing a commendation.
}

{voltage_captured:
    And you captured Voltage. Excellent.
- else:
    Voltage escaped?
}

-> debrief_intelligence_gathered

=== debrief_voltage_status ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

{voltage_captured:
    Excellent. Voltage is high-value intelligence.

    His interrogation will provide significant insight into The Architect's infrastructure initiative.
- else:
    Unfortunate. But the attack is stopped—that's the priority.

    Lives saved matter more than one operative.
}

-> debrief_intelligence_gathered

=== debrief_intelligence_gathered ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

The intelligence you gathered confirms our worst fears.

Critical Mass and Social Fabric were coordinating this attack.

{voltage_captured:
    Voltage's interrogation has already begun. He's defiant, but he's confirming cross-cell operations.
- else:
    The documents you recovered show clear coordination between cells.
}

This wasn't random.

Social Fabric was ready with disinformation campaigns in three cities—they planned to amplify the panic from thermal runaway.

* [The Architect. They're coordinating all of this.]
    -> debrief_architect_revelation

* [How extensive is this coordination?]
    -> debrief_scale_explanation

=== debrief_architect_revelation ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

Yes. We've intercepted communications mentioning "The Architect."

Someone is coordinating ENTROPY cells at a level we've never seen before.

This facility was a test run.

The Architect is planning something bigger—coordinated infrastructure attacks with synchronized disinformation campaigns.

-> debrief_task_force_announcement

=== debrief_scale_explanation ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

{voltage_captured:
    Voltage mentioned operations in six cities.

    OptiGrid Solutions—their cover company—has contracts at 40 facilities nationwide.

    We're running full security audits now.
- else:
    The documents reference operations in multiple cities.

    OptiGrid Solutions contracts appear at dozens of critical infrastructure sites.
}

This is coordinated at an unprecedented level.

-> debrief_task_force_announcement

=== debrief_task_force_announcement ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

SAFETYNET is forming a special task force dedicated to hunting The Architect and dismantling coordinated ENTROPY operations.

Task Force Null.

You're being assigned.

* [What's Task Force Null's mission?]
    -> task_force_mission_explanation

* [I'm ready. When do we start?]
    -> task_force_accepted

=== task_force_mission_explanation ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

This isn't about stopping individual cells anymore.

We're going after the network. The Architect. The coordination infrastructure.

You've proven yourself across four missions now.

First Contact. Ransomed Trust. Ghost in the Machine. And now this—Critical Failure.

You're ready for this.

-> task_force_accepted

=== task_force_accepted ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

~ task_force_null_assigned = true

Good. Task Force Null briefing is tomorrow at 0600.

Now—there's one more decision to make.

{racks_vented:
    Agent HaX: The banks are isolated, but Bank B went before you got to the button. Nine on the night crew in Hall 2. Two more on the feed before the grid caught up.
    Agent HaX: You stopped the rest of it. I need you to hold on to that, because the number you're going to read tomorrow is not zero.
- else:
    Agent HaX: Eleven people on site tonight walked out of there. Forty-odd on that feed never knew they were on it.
    Agent HaX: That's the whole job. That's what it looks like when it works.
}

Agent HaX: But...

-> disclosure_decision

=== disclosure_decision ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

// Robert Vance present, listening

How do we handle this publicly?

The facility manager needs to know our approach.

* [Full public disclosure. People have a right to know.]
    -> disclosure_full_public

* [Classify the incident. Let the facility patch vulnerabilities quietly.]
    -> disclosure_quiet

* [Acknowledge a security incident without full details. Controlled narrative.]
    -> disclosure_partial

=== disclosure_full_public ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

~ disclosure_choice = "full"

Full transparency. We reveal the attack attempt, facility vulnerabilities, and ENTROPY threat.

{not robert_vance_ko:
    // Robert Vance reacts
    #speaker:robert_vance
    {chen_trust_level >= 70:
        It'll damage the facility's reputation, but... people have a right to know how close this came.
    - else:
        The public backlash will be severe. But I understand the reasoning.
    }
    #speaker:agent_0x99
}

Consequences:
- Public protected through awareness of infrastructure risks
- Facility reputation damaged
- Industry-wide security investigations triggered
- Political pressure for infrastructure funding

This will force systemic change.

Approved.

-> disclosure_outcome

=== disclosure_quiet ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

~ disclosure_choice = "quiet"

We classify the incident. Frame it as a "maintenance issue" that was resolved.

Facility patches vulnerabilities quietly.

{not robert_vance_ko:
    // Robert Vance reacts
    #speaker:robert_vance
    {chen_trust_level >= 70:
        I understand the reasoning, but... is it right to hide this from the people we serve?
    - else:
        Thank you. The facility can't afford the reputational damage right now.
    }
    #speaker:agent_0x99
}

Consequences:
- Public uninformed of risk
- Facility reputation intact
- Security upgrades done discretely
- No systemic pressure for change

Stability over transparency.

Approved.

-> disclosure_outcome

=== disclosure_partial ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

~ disclosure_choice = "partial"

Acknowledge a "security incident" without full details. Controlled narrative.

{not robert_vance_ko:
    // Robert Vance reacts
    #speaker:robert_vance
    {chen_trust_level >= 70:
        A middle ground. People know something happened without full panic. I can work with that.
    - else:
        Probably the most politically viable option.
    }
    #speaker:agent_0x99
}

Consequences:
- Moderate public awareness
- Balanced transparency and stability
- Some pressure for security improvements
- Controlled narrative

Balanced approach.

Approved.

-> disclosure_outcome

=== disclosure_outcome ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

Decision recorded.

{disclosure_choice == "full":
    Public statement will be coordinated with local authorities.
}
{disclosure_choice == "quiet":
    Incident remains classified. Cover story prepared.
}

    Controlled statement will be prepared for media.

{not robert_vance_ko:

    {chen_trust_level >= 80:
        Thank you.

        I don't know your real name, but... thank you.

        You saved this facility. You saved 240,000 people.
    }
    {chen_trust_level >= 50 and chen_trust_level < 80:
        You did good work here.

        This facility won't forget it.
    }

        I appreciate what you did, even if I don't fully understand it.

I'll begin implementing security overhauls immediately.

Noted. It'll be in the report either way.

The methods are a separate conversation. You put a facility manager on the floor of his own control room tonight.

Get some rest, {player_name()}.

Task Force Null briefing tomorrow at 0600.

    We'll find Voltage. And The Architect.

    You neutralized all their operatives. Textbook operation.

    Two operatives down. Clean work.
