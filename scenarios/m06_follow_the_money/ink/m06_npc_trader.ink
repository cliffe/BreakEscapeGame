    #speaker:narrator
    Narrator: A young trader watches six price charts at once, placing the occasional order without appearing to look at it.

    Dani Okonkwo: Hey, you're the compliance person, right? From FinCEN?

    Dani Okonkwo: Don't worry, we're legit. Mostly. *grins*

    + [Mostly? That's an interesting qualifier.]
        Dani Okonkwo: *laughs* I'm kidding. Everything's above board. Elena makes sure of that.
        -> hub

    + [It's a standard audit. Nothing to worry about, if everything's compliant.]
        Dani Okonkwo: Cool cool. Let me know if you need anything.
        -> hub

    + [Tell me about the exchange's operations]

=== operations_overview ===
#speaker:trader

Dani Okonkwo: We're a mid-size crypto exchange. Focus on privacy coins—Monero, Zcash, stuff like that.

Dani Okonkwo: High volume, fast transactions, low fees. Competitive market.

+ [Why focus on privacy coins?]
    -> privacy_coin_focus

~ topic_volume = true

Dani Okonkwo: We're doing like $800-900 million USD equivalent per day.

Dani Okonkwo: Not bad for a mid-size exchange. Elena's infrastructure is solid.

Dani Okonkwo: Mostly Bitcoin, Ethereum, but the Monero volume has been crazy lately.

+ [Crazy how?]
    -> monero_surge

+ [That's impressive volume]
    Dani Okonkwo: Yeah, privacy coin demand is skyrocketing.
    -> hub

=== monero_surge ===
#speaker:trader

Dani Okonkwo: Like, 3-4x normal. Big wallets converting Bitcoin to Monero, mixing through multiple addresses, converting back.

Dani Okonkwo: Classic mixing pattern. Totally legal, but... yeah.

+ [You report these patterns?]
    -> reporting_discussion

+ [Is that suspicious?]
    -> suspicious_activity

=== reporting_discussion ===
#speaker:trader

Dani Okonkwo: Oh yeah, we flag everything. Elena runs analysis, files SARs when needed.

Dani Okonkwo: We're compliant. Just... we're also privacy-focused. That's our brand.

-> hub

=== suspicious_activity ===
#speaker:trader

Dani Okonkwo: *shrugs* Depends on your perspective.

Dani Okonkwo: Some people want financial privacy. Some want to hide money. Hard to tell which is which from transaction patterns.

Dani Okonkwo: That's your job, I guess. *gestures at you*

// PRIVACY COIN FOCUS

#speaker:trader
~ topic_monero = true

Dani Okonkwo: Satoshi's philosophy. "Financial freedom through cryptography."

Dani Okonkwo: People should be able to transact without government surveillance. Privacy is a right.

+ [That sounds like ideology, not business]
    -> ideology_response

+ [Privacy can enable illegal activity]
    -> illegal_activity_response

=== ideology_response ===
#speaker:trader

Dani Okonkwo: It's both! Satoshi's a true believer, but it's also profitable.

Dani Okonkwo: Privacy coin traders pay premium fees. We make bank.

-> hub

=== illegal_activity_response ===
#speaker:trader

Dani Okonkwo: Sure. And regular currency enables illegal activity too.

Dani Okonkwo: You gonna shut down every bank because some people launder money?

Dani Okonkwo: We follow the law. We file reports. What people do with their privacy is their business.

~ topic_monero = true

Dani Okonkwo: Monero's untraceable. That's the whole point.

Dani Okonkwo: Bitcoin is pseudonymous—you can track wallets. Monero is truly anonymous.

Dani Okonkwo: Makes it perfect for privacy. Also perfect for money laundering, I guess.

+ [Do you think the exchange is being used for money laundering?]
    -> laundering_opinion

+ [How does the mixing work?]
    -> mixing_explanation

=== laundering_opinion ===
#speaker:trader

Dani Okonkwo: *uncomfortable* I mean... I don't ask questions. I just execute trades.

Dani Okonkwo: Elena and Satoshi handle compliance. I'm just the guy watching charts.

+ [You must have suspicions]
    -> trader_suspicions

+ [Fair enough]
    -> hub

=== trader_suspicions ===
#speaker:trader

Dani Okonkwo: *lowers voice* Between you and me? Some of the transaction patterns are... weird.

Dani Okonkwo: Like, coordinated. Multiple big wallets mixing at the same time, same amounts, same destination patterns.

Dani Okonkwo: I flagged it to Elena. She said she's investigating.

Dani Okonkwo: But honestly? I just want to keep my job and not think about it too hard.

-> hub

=== mixing_explanation ===
#speaker:trader

Dani Okonkwo: User sends Bitcoin to us. We convert to Monero. Send through 5-10 different wallets.

Dani Okonkwo: Then convert back to Bitcoin from a completely unlinked address.

Dani Okonkwo: Blockchain shows Bitcoin in, Bitcoin out. But the Monero middle step? Untraceable.

Dani Okonkwo: Perfectly legal mixing service. We're transparent about it.

~ topic_elena = true

Dani Okonkwo: Elena's brilliant. Like, PhD in cryptography brilliant.

Dani Okonkwo: She designed all our privacy protocols. Zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption...

Dani Okonkwo: Way above my paygrade. I just use the systems she builds.

+ [Does she seem concerned about compliance?]
    -> elena_compliance

+ [What's your impression of her?]
    -> elena_impression

=== elena_compliance ===
#speaker:trader

Dani Okonkwo: Obsessively. She reviews every flagged transaction personally.

Dani Okonkwo: Actually, she's been stressed lately. I think some of the activity patterns are bothering her.

Dani Okonkwo: But she hasn't said anything specific.

-> hub

=== elena_impression ===
#speaker:trader

Dani Okonkwo: Smart, intense, kinda distant. But fair.

Dani Okonkwo: She believes in what we're doing—financial privacy as a right.

Dani Okonkwo: I think she struggles with the fact that good tech can be used for bad things.
