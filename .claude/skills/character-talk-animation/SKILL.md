# Break Escape — character talk animation

Produces the source portrait for a `<character>_talk.png` talk sheet, for a character that **already exists** as a walk-cycle sprite sheet in `public/break_escape/assets/characters/`. The Gemini portrait is the part worth automating; the pixel-art conversion and mouth animation are not (see "Why this stops at Step 2" below) and are handed to the user instead.

## What the engine expects (for context — the user does this part)

`public/break_escape/js/minigames/person-chat/person-chat-portraits.js` loads `<character>_talk.png` and treats it as a 2×2 spritesheet when the image is square, even, and ≥256px:

- **256×256 RGBA PNG**, four 128×128 frames in a 2×2 grid, transparent background.
- **Frame 0 (top-left)** — mouth closed, neutral. Shown whenever the NPC is silent.
- **Frames 1, 2, 3** — three different open-mouth / mid-speech poses, cycled at ~5fps while TTS is speaking.
- Only the face should change between frames — body, arms, clothing, hair silhouette and shoulders must stay pixel-identical, or the portrait visibly jitters.

All go in `public/break_escape/assets/characters/`.

## Step 0 — study the existing sprite

Read the character's walk sheet (`<name>.png`) and its headshot (`<name>_headshot.png`) with the Read tool before writing any prompt. Note, in order:

1. Skin tone.
2. Hair — colour, texture (coily / straight / wavy), and how it is worn (ponytail, puff, bun, loose, tucked).
3. Garment — exact colour and cut (e.g. *deep navy blue V-neck scrubs*, *pale grey lab coat over a navy tee*).
4. Accessories that read at 128px — stethoscope, lanyard, badge, glasses. Drop anything smaller than that; it becomes mud.

The portrait must be recognisably the *same person* as the walk sprite, because the player sees both. Also check `list_characters` on PixelLab — the original character was often generated there and its description string is the best possible reference.

## Step 1 — Gemini non-pixel portrait

Use `mcp__nanobanana__gemini_generate_image` with `aspect_ratio: "1:1"` and `output_path` set to `<...>/characters/<name>_nonpixelart.png`. Pass the source sprite sheet as a `reference_images` entry so the outfit and colouring carry over.

Keep the prompt in this exact structure — it is tuned for this pipeline and the paragraph order matters. Substitute the bracketed parts only:

```
Make portrait for [Character name]
[One or two sentences of physical description: ethnicity/skin tone, role, garment
and its exact colour, hair colour + texture + how it is worn, any accessory.]
Body angled slightly to the side in a three-quarter turn, head turned toward the camera.
Dialog view of character
Dramatic lighting
In the style of a detailed vector graphics illustration. the portrait shows the body from the hips up, including the waistline, belt, pockets and top of the trousers, against a solid plain magenta background, in a game art design, realism and digital art aesthetic. Dialog character. Gritty realism.
Slightly anime. Neutral expression.
Square aspect ratio
solid uniform magenta background, no gradient, no pattern
```

Notes:

- **"Neutral expression"** is load-bearing — this becomes frame 0 (mouth closed).
- **"three-quarter turn"** is load-bearing — a straight-on, camera-facing pose reads flat and doesn't match the rest of the dialogue cast.
- **"hips up, including the waistline, belt, pockets and top of the trousers"** is load-bearing — cropping at the chest loses the waist/trouser detail that should be visible in frame, and a head-only crop leaves nothing for the body at all, so the 128px conversion loses the outfit entirely.
- Keep the last five lines verbatim. They are what makes the output match the existing cast (`female_scientist`, `female_office_worker`, `female_spy`).
- **Ask for a solid magenta background, never "transparent."** Gemini cannot actually produce transparency — asking for it just gets a fake checkerboard baked into RGB with alpha=255 throughout. Worse, that checkerboard's shade varies between generations and looks like real image content (white lab coats, skin highlights), so any brightness-based heuristic trying to key it out will eat into the character instead of the background — this happened for real on `female_nurse1` and `male_scientist` and shredded both portraits. A solid, saturated, off-palette colour like magenta has no ambiguity: Step 1b keys exactly that one RGB value, nothing else, so it can't be confused with clothing or skin. If the render comes back with any gradient, shadow, or pattern in the background instead of a flat colour, re-roll — Step 1b needs a genuinely uniform colour to key correctly.

Review the image before continuing. Re-roll if: the expression is not neutral, the pose is straight-on rather than angled, the crop stops above the waist or is head-only or full-body, the hands are mangled and visible, or the character does not read as the same person as the walk sprite.

**Gemini also reliably ignores "zoom out" / "pan down" edit instructions on its own output** — if the first pass is too tightly cropped, don't try to fix it with a `gemini_edit_image` reframe request; regenerate from scratch with a prompt that front-loads "waist up" instead.

## Step 1b — key out the background and reframe (always run this, never skip)

Run this on every `<name>_nonpixelart.png`, immediately after Step 1, before showing it as done:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/character-talk-animation/scripts/reframe_portrait.py \
  public/break_escape/assets/characters/<name>_nonpixelart.png
```

It does two things in one pass, both mandatory:

1. **Keys the solid magenta background to true alpha transparency.** It flood-fills inward from the image border over pixels close to the exact chroma-key colour (default `255,0,255`, tolerance 40), not a brightness heuristic — so it cannot be confused with a white lab coat, a pale stethoscope, or a skin highlight the way a "near-neutral" test could. Flood filling from the border (rather than keying every matching pixel image-wide) is still there as a second layer of safety in case a stray near-magenta pixel ever turns up inside the artwork.
2. **Reframes so the character fills the square**, cropping to the character's own bounding box rather than leaving Gemini's padding in. This is also the fix for the "ignores zoom out" problem above — do this instead of another Gemini round-trip.

If the Gemini render used a background colour other than magenta for some reason, pass it explicitly: `--bg-color 0,255,0` (green) etc. — don't just rerun with the default and hope.

A run with `character bbox: x0-1023 y0-1023 of (1024, 1024)` means the flood fill matched nothing and the image is still fully opaque — check the actual background colour (`Image.open(path).getpixel((5,5))`) before assuming this step failed; if Gemini didn't render a flat, uniform, close-to-magenta background, don't try to loosen `--tolerance` to compensate — that reintroduces exactly the "eats real content" failure mode this script was rewritten to avoid. Re-roll Step 1 instead.

**If Step 1b visibly shreds real image content** (parts of the face, clothing folds, or highlights turn transparent instead of just the background), that means Step 1's render did not actually use a clean uniform background colour — do not try to patch it by adjusting tolerance or re-running; delete the bad output and regenerate from Step 1.

Verify before moving on:

```bash
python3 -c "
from PIL import Image
im = Image.open('public/break_escape/assets/characters/<name>_nonpixelart.png').convert('RGBA')
print(im.split()[3].getextrema())"
```

Anything other than `(0, 255)` means the background is still opaque — do not proceed to Step 2 until this passes.

## Step 2 — hand off to the user

Tell the user the portrait is ready at `<name>_nonpixelart.png`, and ask them to:

1. Open **pixellab.ai → Image to pixel art**.
2. Upload `<name>_nonpixelart.png`.
3. Set **Output Scale ÷8** (1024→128) and **reference/init strength ~500**.
4. Remove the background.
5. Save the result as `<name>_talk_init.png` (128×128, alpha-transparent) in `public/break_escape/assets/characters/`.
6. From that same bust, use PixelLab's animation tooling (or ask this skill to resume) to generate a talking/mouth-movement animation, and save frames or the finished `<name>_talk.png` sheet back into the same folder.

Once the user has produced `<name>_talk_init.png` and/or raw animation frames, this skill can resume to composite the final 2×2 sheet — see "Resuming after the user's manual step" below.

## Why this stops at Step 2 (do not re-attempt full automation without reading this)

PixelLab's "Image to pixel art" tool (with Output Scale and init-strength controls) is **not exposed through any MCP tool** — confirmed against the full 64-tool list at `https://api.pixellab.ai/mcp/docs`. The closest MCP equivalents (`create_portrait_character`, `create_1_direction_object` + `animate_object`) take inline base64 image uploads only, and that upload path is unreliable enough to make full automation not worth attempting:

- Payloads fail to decode ("broken data stream") at every size tried, from ~9 KB to ~30 KB, sometimes truncated in transit and sometimes arriving full-length but corrupted. Retries succeed unpredictably — including on a byte-identical payload.
- **Worse: a corrupted upload can succeed silently.** In one run, `custom_start_frame_base64` was accepted with no error, and the resulting 30-minute `animate_object` job produced visual noise for every frame — because the "clean" starting image it thought it received was itself corrupted. There is no reliable way to detect this before the job completes, so a failure here is not "retry immediately" but "burn ~30 minutes and generations to find out."
- Re-encoding the PNG through PIL (`Image.frombytes('RGBA', im.size, im.convert('RGBA').tobytes())`, saved with `optimize=True`) has fixed some but not all of these failures — it appears to help by stripping ancillary chunks the source export tool adds, but it is not a guarantee.

Given that a "success" can quietly be a corrupted animation burned through a 30-minute job, treat any full MCP-only attempt at Steps 2–4 as experimental, not the default path. If asked to try anyway, warn the user explicitly about the silent-corruption failure mode before starting, and verify frame 0 by eye against the local init image before letting a long animation job run.

## Resuming after the user's manual step

Once `<name>_talk_init.png` exists and the user has either:

**(a) provided a finished `<name>_talk.png`** — verify it with:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/character-talk-animation/scripts/check_talk_sheet.py \
  public/break_escape/assets/characters/<name>_talk.png
```

Nothing else to do if it passes.

**(b) provided raw animation frames** (a folder of 128×128 PNGs, one per pose, frame 0 = mouth closed) — composite them mechanically, do not regenerate anything:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/character-talk-animation/scripts/build_talk_sheet.py \
  --base   public/break_escape/assets/characters/<name>_talk_init.png \
  --frames <dir-of-frames>/*.png \
  --out    public/break_escape/assets/characters/<name>_talk.png
```

This takes frame 0 as the canonical base, auto-detects the face box, picks the three most distinct candidates for the mouth, and pastes only that region over a copy of the base — so the body stays byte-identical across all four output frames regardless of what the source frames' bodies did. Sanity target from the reference asset (`female_scientist_talk.png`): 200–450 changed pixels per frame, confined to the head box. Then run `check_talk_sheet.py` as above.

## Step (final) — wire it up (only if asked)

The sheet is picked up automatically by filename convention wherever the NPC's `spriteTalk` points at it. If the user wants it used, set `spriteTalk` in the relevant scenario NPC definition to `assets/characters/<name>_talk.png`. Do not edit scenarios unless asked.

## Cost

Step 1 (this skill) costs a handful of Gemini generations, no PixelLab spend. The user's manual PixelLab pass costs PixelLab credits/generations on their own account — mention that up front but don't try to estimate it, since it depends on the website tool's own pricing, not the MCP generation costs quoted for `create_portrait_character` etc.
