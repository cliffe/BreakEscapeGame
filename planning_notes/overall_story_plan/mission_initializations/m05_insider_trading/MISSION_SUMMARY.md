# Mission 5 "Insider Trading" - Planning Summary & Implementation Guide

## Mission Overview

**Mission ID:** M05
**Title:** Insider Trading
**Duration:** 70-90 minutes
**Difficulty:** Tier 2 (Intermediate)
**Type:** Investigation / Social Engineering / VM Exploitation

**ENTROPY Cell:** Insider Threat Initiative
**SecGen Scenario:** "Feeling Blu" (Bludit CMS exploitation)
**VM Flags:** 4 flags (reconnaissance, exploitation, data discovery, Architect communications)

---

## Executive Summary

Mission 5 "Insider Trading" is a corporate espionage investigation where players infiltrate **Quantum Dynamics Corporation** to identify and stop an insider exfiltrating classified quantum cryptography research. The insider, **David Torres**, was systematically targeted by ENTROPY's Insider Threat Initiative due to crushing medical debt ($180K) from his wife Elena's terminal cancer.

**Key Design Innovation:** Torres is a **sympathetic villain** - a desperate father manipulated by ENTROPY, not a true believer. He believes he's helping "investigative journalists" expose defense corruption, unaware his data is being sold to foreign governments (China, Russia, Iran) for $68 million, which will result in 12-40 intelligence officer deaths.

**Core Gameplay Loop:**
1. **Investigation** - Review security logs, identify suspicious patterns
2. **Social Engineering** - Clone badges, interview employees, build trust
3. **Evidence Gathering** - Search Torres' office, discover medical bills/journal/communications
4. **VM Exploitation** - Hack Bludit CMS server for 4 flags proving ENTROPY involvement
5. **Evidence Correlation** - Synthesize physical + digital evidence at Evidence Board
6. **Confrontation** - Present evidence to Torres, reveal manipulation, make critical choice

**Four Endings:**
1. **Turn Double Agent** (S-Rank) - Torres becomes SAFETYNET asset, helps expose 47 other targets
2. **Arrest** - By-the-book justice, Torres faces espionage charges
3. **Sympathetic Release** - Let Torres go with warning (moral mercy, operational risk)
4. **Public Exposure** - Leak to media, destroy ENTROPY's program + Torres' life

- Torres listed as "QD-001" with exact vulnerability scores
- Shows other victims: Marcus (gambling), Rachel (son's treatment)
- Vulnerability scoring: Financial (35%), Access (40%), Psychological (25%)
- "Torres template effective" - implies they'll recruit more like him

**Debrief Integration:**
- Each fragment acknowledged by Agent 0x99
- Complete collection unlocks `lore_completionist` bonus
- Evidence supports "turn double agent" path (Torres sees manipulation)

## Character Profiles

### David Torres (Primary Antagonist - Sympathetic Villain)
**Role:** Cryptography Lead, Quantum Dynamics Corporation
**Age:** 38

```

**Torres Confrontation - Turn Double Agent Path:**
```ink
=== turn_double_agent_path ===
You: I'm not here to arrest you, David.

{found_target_criteria:
    You: Yes, I found the database. You're "QD-001." There are 46 others.
    Torres: *horrified* Forty-six more people like me?
}

Torres: And... Elena?

=== torres_accepts ===
Torres: *nods slowly* Okay. Okay, I'll do it.
Torres: What do you need from me?

You: First, stop the current upload. Then we'll debrief properly.
You: The Recruiter will contact you again. When they do, you come to us immediately.

Torres: And the 46 others?

## Campaign Integration

### If Torres Turned (Double Agent Path):
**Impact on M6-M10:**
- Torres provides intelligence on 22 active insider placements
- Identifies 47 targets under evaluation
- SAFETYNET can warn/protect vulnerable employees before recruitment
- Torres' ongoing cooperation provides ENTROPY intel throughout campaign
- Elena's treatment funded (positive moral outcome)

**Mission 6+ References:**
```ink
=== m06_briefing ===
Agent 0x99: Thanks to Torres, we identified three more insiders before ENTROPY activated them.
Agent 0x99: His intelligence is proving invaluable.
{elena_treatment_funded:
    Agent 0x99: And his wife's treatment is going well. He's motivated to help.
}
```

### If Torres Arrested:
**Impact on M6-M10:**
- Standard espionage prosecution
- No ongoing intelligence from insider program
- ENTROPY continues recruiting (47 targets still vulnerable)
- By-the-book justice, but missed strategic opportunity

### If Torres Released (Sympathetic):
**Impact on M6-M10:**
- Operational risk (Torres could be re-recruited)
- Elena's treatment still in jeopardy (Torres remains desperate)
- ENTROPY likely marks Torres as compromised, burns him
- Moral mercy, but strategic weakness

### If Program Exposed Publicly:
**Impact on M6-M10:**
- ENTROPY's Insider Threat Initiative burned
- 22 active placements compromised
- 47 targets now aware, unlikely to be recruited
- Torres' life destroyed (public traitor)
- ENTROPY retaliates in future missions

## Design Philosophy Summary

**Core Tension:** Justice vs. Mercy
**Moral Complexity:** Villain who's actually a victim
**Player Agency:** Choice matters, consequences tracked across campaign
**Evidence-Based Gameplay:** Investigation unlocks confrontation, not arbitrary timer
**Hybrid Architecture:** VM challenges correlate with physical evidence

**What Makes This Mission Unique:**
1. **Sympathetic Antagonist:** Torres can be turned, not just stopped
2. **Systematic Evil:** ENTROPY recruits desperate people, weaponizes suffering
3. **Concrete Stakes:** Specific casualties (12-40), specific victims (47 targets)
4. **Moral Choice:** No "right" answer - arrest (justice), turn (strategy), release (mercy), expose (nuclear option)
5. **Campaign Impact:** Choice affects M6-M10 (Torres as asset or missed opportunity)

**Mission 5 Planning: COMPLETE**
**Total Planning Documentation:** 5,632 lines across 6 stages
