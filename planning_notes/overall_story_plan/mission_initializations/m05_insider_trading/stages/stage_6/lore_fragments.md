INSIDER THREAT INITIATIVE - OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW
Classification: ENTROPY INTERNAL USE ONLY
Distribution: Cell Leaders, Recruitment Division
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

MISSION STATEMENT:
The Insider Threat Initiative identifies and recruits
high-value employees within target organizations suffering
financial or personal crises.

RECRUITMENT METHODOLOGY:

Phase 1: TARGET IDENTIFICATION
- Financial distress (medical debt, gambling, divorce)
- Access to classified/valuable data
- Clean security record (no prior flags)
- Emotional vulnerability (family crisis, substance abuse)

Phase 2: INITIAL CONTACT
- Approach via encrypted channels
- Pose as "investigative journalists"
- Offer financial compensation for "whistleblowing"
- Frame exfiltration as "exposing corruption"

Phase 3: ESCALATION
- Gradually reveal true nature of operation
- Increase payment amounts
- Create dependency relationship
- Leverage compromising evidence if necessary

CURRENT OPERATIONS: 22 active placements
ANNUAL REVENUE: $180-240 million (stolen data sales)

TARGET SECTORS: Defense, Technology, Healthcare, Finance

[Handwritten note at bottom]:
"Remember - they're not criminals. They're desperate people
we're helping. The truth about buyers comes later."
- The Recruiter

[Another note, different handwriting]:
"Approved. Increase targeting budget by 40%. Priority:
quantum computing sector."

- "Investigative journalists" lie confirms Torres' journal entries about believing he was helping expose corruption
- 22 active placements = ongoing threat beyond this mission
- Handwritten notes add authenticity and reveal The Recruiter + The Architect's approval

ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATION LOG - OPERATION SCHRÖDINGER
Classification: ARCHITECT EYES ONLY
From: [The Architect]
To: The Recruiter (Insider Threat Initiative)
Subject: Target Quantum Dynamics - Authorization
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The Recruiter,

Authorization granted for Operation Schrödinger.

TARGET: Quantum Dynamics Corporation
OBJECTIVE: Exfiltrate Project Heisenberg quantum
cryptography research (4.2 TB)

ASSET: David Torres, PhD - Cryptography Lead
VULNERABILITY: Medical debt ($180K), wife terminal illness
RECRUITMENT STATUS: Active, 73% exfiltration complete

DISTRIBUTION PLAN:
- Primary buyer: Chinese MSS ($28 million)
- Secondary buyer: Russian GRU ($22 million)
- Tertiary buyer: Iranian MOIS ($18 million)
PROJECTED REVENUE: $68 million

STRATEGIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
- U.S. quantum crypto advantage: ELIMINATED
- Retroactive decryption of classified comms: ENABLED
- Projected intelligence officer casualties: 12-40
- DoD quantum program: $4.2 billion WASTED

RISK LEVEL: Medium
- Asset believes data going to "investigative journalists"
- Asset unaware of foreign government sales
- Asset unaware of casualty projections
- Maintain plausible deniability until exfiltration complete

TIMELINE:
- Exfiltration completion: 14 days
- Analysis & packaging: 21 days
- Distribution to buyers: 35 days
- First casualties (retroactive decryption): 60-90 days

STATUS: Approved. Proceed as planned.

Do NOT inform asset of true buyers until data secured.
Maintain "whistleblowing" narrative for now.

If compromised: Asset is expendable. Prioritize data.

  "discoveryDialogue": "The Architect personally authorized this operation. This proves ENTROPY leadership approved selling quantum crypto research to foreign governments, knowing it would cost lives."
}
```

**Design Notes:**
- **CRITICAL EVIDENCE** - proves Torres manipulated, didn't know about foreign governments
- Specific numbers: $68M revenue, 12-40 casualties, 4.2 TB data, $4.2B DoD program
- "Asset is expendable" - shows ENTROPY's cold calculation
- Timeline shows imminent threat (14 days to completion)
- Matches exactly with Stage 0 initialization details
- Finding this increases `evidence_level` (needed for confrontation)
- Player can show this to Torres in confrontation: "You thought you were helping journalists? They're selling to China, Russia, and Iran."

PROJECT HEISENBERG - TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
Classification: DoD TOP SECRET // SCI // NOFORN
Quantum Dynamics Corporation - Defense Contract QD-2024-7731
Lead Scientist: Dr. Sarah Chen, PhD
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) system for military/
intelligence communications encryption using entangled
photon pairs for theoretically unbreakable security.

CAPABILITIES:
- 847 pages of QKD protocols (classified methodology)
- 14 zero-day vulnerabilities in competitor systems
- 247 DoD facility deployment database
- Cryptographic key material from government testing

DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
- Phase 1 Complete: Laboratory validation
- Phase 2 In Progress: Field testing (8 military bases)
- Phase 3 Planned: Full deployment (247 facilities)

STRATEGIC VALUE:
Project Heisenberg provides U.S. intelligence community
with encryption immune to quantum computing attacks.
Compromise would enable adversaries to:
1. Decrypt retroactively stored communications
2. Expose human intelligence sources
3. Compromise field operative identities
4. Neutralize U.S. quantum crypto advantage for decade

SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED: TS/SCI
NEED-TO-KNOW: Cryptography Division Only

[Handwritten note]:
"David Torres has full access. Background check clean.
Recommend continued clearance."
- Security Review Board, 6 months ago

  "loreValue": 12,
  "discoveryDialogue": "This explains what Torres stole. Project Heisenberg is quantum encryption for intelligence communications. If foreign governments get this, they can decrypt everything—past and future."
}
```

**Design Notes:**
- NOT direct evidence of evil, but explains stakes
- Shows Torres had legitimate access (not hacking in)
- "Background check clean" makes his recruitment more tragic
- 247 facilities = massive deployment scale
- Optional fragment - enriches understanding but not required
- Helps player understand why ENTROPY targeted Quantum Dynamics specifically

**Discovery:** Optional exploration, requires lockpick or locker key

**Purpose:**
- Reveals systematic profiling methodology
- Shows ENTROPY's cold calculation in targeting vulnerable people
- Provides database of active targets
- Demonstrates this is ongoing program, not isolated incident

## Debrief Integration

**Agent 0x99's Debrief should acknowledge discovered LORE:**

```ink
=== debrief_lore_acknowledgment ===

{found_recruiting_pamphlet:
    Agent 0x99: You found the Insider Threat Initiative recruitment document.
    Agent 0x99: This proves Torres wasn't a random opportunity. He was systematically targeted.
}

{found_architect_protocol:
    Agent 0x99: The Architect's authorization is damning evidence.
    Agent 0x99: They calculated the casualties—12 to 40 intelligence officers—and approved anyway.
    Agent 0x99: "Asset is expendable." That's how they saw Torres. A tool.
}

{found_target_criteria:
    Agent 0x99: The target selection database... *shakes head*
    Agent 0x99: 47 people profiled. Medical debt, sick family members, desperation.
    Agent 0x99: ENTROPY weaponizes human suffering. They're not just criminals—they're predators.

    {torres_turned:
        Agent 0x99: At least Torres can help us identify the others. Maybe we can stop them before they're compromised.
    - else:
        Agent 0x99: We need to identify those 47 targets before ENTROPY recruits them.
    }
}

{found_heisenberg_specs:
    Agent 0x99: The Project Heisenberg specifications explain why this mattered so much.
    Agent 0x99: 247 military facilities were set to deploy this. Quantum crypto, unbreakable encryption.
    Agent 0x99: If foreign governments had gotten that data... we'd be blind for a decade.
}

{found_recruiting_pamphlet and found_architect_protocol and found_target_criteria:
    Agent 0x99: You found all the key evidence. The recruiting methodology, The Architect's approval, the target database.
    Agent 0x99: This isn't just about stopping Torres. We're exposing an entire recruitment program.
