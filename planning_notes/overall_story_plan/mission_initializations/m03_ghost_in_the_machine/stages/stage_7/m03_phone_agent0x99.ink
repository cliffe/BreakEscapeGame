=== hint_rfid_cloning ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

~ hint_rfid_cloning_given = true

Agent 0x99: RFID cloning - get within 2 meters of Victoria for about 10 seconds.

Agent 0x99: The device will vibrate when complete. Keep her talking while it works.

Agent 0x99: Best moment: when you're both standing near the whiteboard or looking at documents together.

+ [Got it]
    Agent 0x99: Natural movement. Don't make it obvious.
    -> hub

+ [What if she notices?]
    Agent 0x99: Play curious recruit. Ask about the training network. She loves talking about her philosophy.
    -> hub

=== hint_lockpicking ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

~ hint_lockpicking_given = true

Agent 0x99: Lockpicking takes time and makes noise. Watch for the guard patrol route.

Agent 0x99: Wait until the guard is at the far end of the patrol before starting.

Agent 0x99: If you have lockpicks in inventory, approach any locked door and interact.

+ [Where can I find lockpicks?]
    Agent 0x99: Check supply closets, maintenance areas, or IT cabinets. Common hiding spots.
    -> hub

+ [Understood]
    -> hub

=== hint_password ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

~ hint_password_given = true

Agent 0x99: People hide password hints everywhere. Sticky notes, desk organizers, whiteboards.

Agent 0x99: For Victoria's computer, look for personal details. Founding year of WhiteHat Security? Significant dates?

Agent 0x99: The reception area often has company history. Plaques, awards, founding information.

+ [I'll look around more carefully]
    Agent 0x99: Thorough search pays off. Don't rush past obvious clues.
    -> hub

=== hint_encoding ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

~ hint_encoding_given = true

Agent 0x99: CyberChef workstation in the server room handles decoding.

Agent 0x99: Common encodings: Base64 (looks random but uses A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /), ROT13 (looks like scrambled English), Hex (pairs of 0-9, A-F).

Agent 0x99: If you decode something and it still looks encoded? Multi-layer encoding. Decode again.

+ [What's the difference between encoding and encryption?]
    Agent 0x99: Encoding is just transformation - no secret key needed. Anyone can reverse it if they know the method.
    Agent 0x99: Encryption requires a key. Much more secure, much harder to break.
    Agent 0x99: ENTROPY uses encoding for speed. Encryption is too slow for operational comms.
    -> hub

+ [Thanks for the primer]
    -> hub

=== hint_network_recon ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

~ hint_network_recon_given = true

Agent 0x99: The VM terminal in the server room connects to Zero Day's training network - 192.168.100.0/24.

Agent 0x99: Start with nmap for network scanning. Then netcat for banner grabbing. Then service-specific tools.

Agent 0x99: Each flag you capture represents intercepted ENTROPY intelligence. Submit them at the drop-site terminal.

+ [What's the target priority?]
    Agent 0x99: Network scan first to map the environment. Then FTP and HTTP for client intel. distcc is the critical one - that's where the operational logs are.

    Agent 0x99: Your methodical approach is smart. Document everything, connect the dots.
}

{player_approach == "aggressive":
    Agent 0x99: Speed is good, but don't miss critical evidence. The hospital connection proof is vital.
}

{player_approach == "diplomatic":
    Agent 0x99: Stay flexible. Read situations. Trust your judgment.
}

Agent 0x99: Remember - Victoria's keycard gets you server room access. Network recon gets you digital evidence. Physical search gets you documents.

Agent 0x99: All three together make the case.

#speaker:agent_0x99

Agent 0x99: Mission objectives recap:

Agent 0x99: Primary - Clone Victoria's RFID keycard, access server room, gather network intelligence, find physical evidence linking Zero Day to St. Catherine's.

Agent 0x99: Optional - Collect LORE fragments for deeper intelligence on ENTROPY's structure.

+ [Remind me about Victoria]
    Agent 0x99: Victoria Sterling, CEO. Codename "Cipher." True believer in free market vulnerability research.
    Agent 0x99: Smart, charismatic, ideologically committed. Don't underestimate her.
    -> hub

+ [What about The Architect?]
    Agent 0x99: The Architect is ENTROPY's leadership figure. We don't have identity confirmation yet.
    Agent 0x99: But evidence suggests they're coordinating all the cells. Zero Day, Ransomware Inc, Social Fabric, all of them.
    Agent 0x99: Any intel you find on The Architect is gold.

[Agent 0x99's avatar appears - serious expression]

Agent 0x99: {player_name}, I just saw the distcc operational logs you submitted.

Agent 0x99: This is... this is the smoking gun.

Agent 0x99: ProFTPD exploit. $12,500. Sold to GHOST. Deployed at St. Catherine's Hospital.

Agent 0x99: Victoria Sterling personally authorized the sale. "Cipher" signature on the approval.

[Pause]

Agent 0x99: Six people died in that attack. Six people.

Agent 0x99: Four in critical care when patient monitoring failed. Two during emergency surgery when systems crashed.

* [We have them now]
    You: This is direct causation. Zero Day → GHOST → St. Catherine's. We can prosecute.
    Agent 0x99: Yes. Federal charges. ENTROPY operational conspiracy. This evidence is ironclad.
    -> m2_revelation_impact

* [Victoria knew exactly what would happen]
    You: The healthcare premium. They charged extra BECAUSE hospitals can't defend themselves.
    Agent 0x99: Calculated exploitation of vulnerability. It's not hacking - it's murder for profit.
    -> m2_revelation_impact

* [This changes everything]
    You: We're not just disrupting a hacking group. This is mass casualty prosecution.
    Agent 0x99: Yes. The stakes just went up. Way up.
    -> m2_revelation_impact

=== m2_revelation_impact ===
#speaker:agent_0x99

Agent 0x99: Keep gathering evidence. Physical documents, LORE fragments, anything that builds the case.

Agent 0x99: And {player_name}? The Architect's directive mentioned Phase 2.

Agent 0x99: 50,000 patient treatment delays. 1.2 million without power in winter.

Agent 0x99: If St. Catherine's was Phase 1... we need to stop Phase 2 before it begins.

* [I'll find everything I can]
    Agent 0x99: I know you will. This is what we trained for.
    -> m2_revelation_end

* [We're bringing them all down]

Agent 0x99: Finish the mission. Document everything. We'll debrief when you're out.
