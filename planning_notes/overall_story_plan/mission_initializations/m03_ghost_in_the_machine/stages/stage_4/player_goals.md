**Mission Type:** Infiltration & Investigation (Undercover)
**Target Difficulty:** Tier 2 (Intermediate)
**Estimated Playtime:** 60-75 minutes

**Objective Philosophy:**

Mission 3 uses a **hybrid progressive structure** that combines:

- **Non-linear investigation** (Act 2: Multiple evidence sources can be pursued in any order)
- **Optional objectives** (LORE fragments, complete stealth, moral choices)

**From Act 2 onwards, objectives are clearly displayed in the UI** to guide players through the investigation phase.

## Success and Failure States

### Complete Success (100%)
- All primary objectives completed (Aims 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
- All 4 VM flags submitted
- All 4 physical evidence tasks completed
- M2 connection discovered
- Victoria confronted with evidence
- Optimal moral choices made (player-defined)
- No detection by guard (perfect stealth)

### Good Success (80-99%)
- All primary objectives completed
- Minimum 3 of 4 VM flags submitted
- M2 connection discovered
- Victoria confronted
- Minor detection incidents (guard alert but not hostile)

### Acceptable Success (60-79%)
- Aims 1.1 and 1.2 completed (or 1.1 and 1.3)
- Minimum 2 VM flags submitted
- Sufficient evidence to identify Zero Day operations
- Victoria may not be confronted
- Some stealth failures (detected but recovered)

### Minimal Success (50-59%)
- Aim 1.1 completed (gained access)
- At least 1 VM flag submitted
- Some evidence gathered (partial intelligence)
- Mission technically complete but incomplete picture

### Failure States

**Mission Cannot Be Permanently Failed** - Player can retry from checkpoints

**Soft Failure Scenarios:**
- Detected by guard 3 times: Mission becomes significantly harder, timer imposed (5 min)
- Victoria becomes suspicious: Locks down server room, must use alternative methods
- RFID cloning failed + low trust: Must lockpick server room door

**Checkpoint System:**
- Checkpoint 1: After Aim 1.1 complete (RFID cloned)
- Checkpoint 2: After server room accessed
- Checkpoint 3: After M2 revelation (distcc_exploit + find_operational_logs)

**Note:** Players can continue campaign regardless of success level. Lower success = fewer intel for future missions.
