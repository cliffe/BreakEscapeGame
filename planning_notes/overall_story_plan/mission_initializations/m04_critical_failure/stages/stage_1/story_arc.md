---

## Mission Premise

**Setting:** Pacific Northwest Regional Water Treatment Facility
**Time:** Early morning, facility operational with day shift starting
**Crisis:** SAFETYNET intelligence indicates ENTROPY's Critical Mass cell has infiltrated the facility and plans to execute a chemical dosing attack on the municipal water supply

**Player Role:** Emergency security auditor (cover identity) sent to identify and neutralize the threat before the attack executes

---

## Three-Act Structure

### ACT 1: UNDERCOVER EMERGENCY (15-20% of playtime)

**Duration:** 12-16 minutes
**Urgency Stage:** Stage 1 - Infiltration (Discovery)
**Tone:** Urgent professionalism, underlying tension

#### Opening Beat: Emergency Briefing (Cutscene)

**Location:** SAFETYNET Mobile Command Unit (background)
**Characters:** Agent 0x99 (briefing), Player

**Key Dialogue Points:**
- 0x99: "At 0342 hours, our signals intelligence intercepted encrypted communications between known Critical Mass operatives and a location inside the Pacific Northwest Regional Water Treatment Facility."
- 0x99: "The facility serves 400,000 residents. A successful attack on the chemical dosing systems could contaminate the entire municipal supply."
- 0x99: "We've identified at least three operatives inside, led by an individual using the callsign 'Voltage.' They're preparing something scheduled for 0800 hours—less than four hours from now."
- 0x99: "Your cover: emergency security auditor from the state regulatory commission. Robert Chen, the facility manager, has been briefed on a 'routine surprise inspection.' He doesn't know about ENTROPY."
- 0x99: "Rules of engagement: these operatives are hostile. If detected, they WILL act to protect their operation. You're authorized for defensive action."
- 0x99: "Primary objective: identify the attack vector and disable it before 0800. Secondary: capture operatives for intelligence. Tertiary: keep this quiet—public panic helps ENTROPY."

**Player Response Options:**
- Professional acknowledgment (efficiency-focused)
- Question about facility manager's security awareness (cautious approach)
- Express concern about civilian safety (compassionate approach)

**0x99's Final Warning:**
- "One more thing—Critical Mass doesn't operate like Social Fabric. They're not ideologues running social media campaigns. They're infrastructure specialists with military training. Stay sharp."

#### Beat 2: Facility Entry

**Location:** Main Entrance/Security Checkpoint
**Characters:** Security Guard (passive), Robert Chen (arrives after entry)

**Player Approach Options:**
1. **Social Engineering (Primary):** Present credentials as state auditor
2. **Stealth (Alternative):** Bypass security through loading dock
3. **RFID Clone (Advanced):** Clone employee badge from parking lot

**Narrative Elements:**
- Security is minimal—aging systems, underfunded facility
- Early shift workers arriving, normal facility operations
- Visual cue: SCADA monitors in security office show green status (everything normal)

**Robert Chen Introduction:**
- Chen arrives, visibly stressed and annoyed about "surprise inspection"
- Dialogue options reveal his character:
  - Professional but defensive about facility security
  - Underfunded and overworked
  - Skeptical of government oversight
  - Cares deeply about facility safety despite frustration

**Key Chen Dialogue:**
- Chen: "State audit at 4 AM? You regulatory people have interesting schedules. Look, we run a tight ship here despite our budget constraints. Whatever boxes you need checked, let's get it done quickly—we have a facility to operate."
- Player can probe about recent security concerns, new employees, or unusual activity
- Chen denies any issues, mentions regular maintenance crew access (foreshadowing)

#### Beat 3: Initial Discovery

**Location:** Administration Offices / Control Room periphery
**Urgency Stage Transition:** Stage 1 → Stage 2 (System Compromise)

**Investigation Phase:**
- Player explores facility under "audit" pretense
- Can examine employee records, access logs, maintenance schedules
- Discovery: Three "maintenance technicians" signed in two days ago—credentials check out but something feels wrong

**First Evidence of Compromise:**
- Option A: Observe SCADA monitor showing subtle anomaly (chemical dosing parameters slowly changing)
- Option B: Find abandoned ENTROPY equipment (encrypted radio, tactical gear) hidden in maintenance area
- Option C: Overhear operative radio chatter while exploring

**Robert Chen's Growing Concern:**
- If player shares concerns, Chen initially dismisses them
- Checking systems together reveals the anomalies
- Chen's tone shifts from defensive to alarmed: "That's not right. Those parameters shouldn't be changing outside of manual input from this terminal..."

**Act 1 Climax: Confirmation of Threat**
- SCADA system shows definitive signs of compromise
- Chen: "My God. Someone's inside the system. The chemical dosing automation—they're setting up a contamination event."
- Player reveals true mission to Chen (dialogue choice: full truth vs. partial disclosure)
- Chen becomes ally: "I know every inch of this facility. Tell me what you need."

**Act 1 Ending:**
- Urgency Stage 2 begins: System Compromise Investigation
- Objective clear: Find operatives, identify attack vector, disable it
- Time context established: Attack scheduled for 0800 (narrative pressure, not countdown)
- Chen provides facility keycard and map
- 0x99 (phone): "Thermal imaging shows three heat signatures in the maintenance wing and server room. They know you're there now. Watch yourself."

---

### ACT 2: INVESTIGATION & COMBAT (50-60% of playtime)

**Duration:** 40-50 minutes
**Urgency Stages:** Stage 2 (System Compromise) → Stage 3 (Attack Preparation)
**Tone:** Escalating tension, action-thriller intensity, investigative urgency

#### Beat 4: First Contact with Hostiles

**Location:** Treatment Floor / Chemical Storage periphery
**Characters:** Critical Mass Field Operative #1 (hostile)

**Combat Tutorial Encounter:**
- Player rounds corner and spots operative tampering with chemical dosing equipment
- Operative immediately hostile upon detection
- Tutorial prompts for combat mechanics:
  - **Stealth Takedown:** Approach undetected, silent non-lethal takedown
  - **Direct Combat:** Engage openly, faster but alerts others
  - **Avoidance:** Retreat and find alternate path

**Operative Behavior:**
- If detected, attempts to radio team: "Security's here—real security. Voltage, we're compromised!"
- If radio call succeeds, other operatives go on alert (harder encounters later)
- If silently defeated, player gains tactical advantage

**Item Drop (First Loot):**
- Level 2 keycard (server room access)
- Encrypted radio (can monitor operative communications)
- Handwritten note: "Dosing station 3—primary. Stations 1&2—redundancy. V confirms 0800 trigger."

**Narrative Impact:**
- Confirms three dosing stations targeted
- Identifies 0800 as attack time
- References "Voltage" as leader
- Player now has partial intel on attack plan

#### Beat 5: Server Room Infiltration

**Location:** Server Room
**Characters:** None (operatives were here but moved)

**Environmental Storytelling:**
- Server racks with visible signs of tampering
- SCADA network terminal still logged in
- Workstation left running—opportunity for VM challenges

**VM Challenge Integration Point:**
- Player accesses terminal to scan SCADA network
- SecGen "Vulnerability Analysis" scenario begins
- Narrative context: "I need to identify which systems they've compromised and how they're controlling the attack"

**VM Challenges (Network Investigation):**

1. **Network Scanning (flag{network_scan_complete}):**
   - Use Nmap to map SCADA network topology
   - Identify compromised systems (chemical dosing controllers)
   - Find suspicious connections to external command server

2. **Service Enumeration (flag{ftp_intel_gathered}):**
   - FTP server with weak credentials
   - Contains attack planning documents
   - Intelligence: "OptiGrid Solutions" mentioned (Critical Mass cover company)

3. **HTTP Analysis (flag{pricing_intel_decoded}):**
   - Web interface to SCADA system shows modified parameters
   - Base64-encoded attack schedule
   - Reveals coordination with "Social Fabric" for public panic disinformation campaign

4. **Distcc Exploitation (flag{distcc_legacy_compromised}):**
   - Legacy distcc service vulnerability on backup SCADA server
   - Exploit to gain access and identify attack vector
   - Sudo Baron privilege escalation to access attack control files
   - Find attack disabling mechanism

**Intelligence Gained from VM Challenges:**
- **Critical Revelation:** Attack coordinated between Critical Mass (infrastructure) and Social Fabric (disinformation)
- Attack timeline: 0800 trigger, chemical contamination takes 2 hours to reach distribution
- Social Fabric ready to amplify panic once contamination detected
- Reference to "The Architect" coordinating multi-cell operation
- Attack is a "test run" for larger infrastructure initiative

**Robert Chen (Phone Call During VM Work):**
- Chen: "I'm monitoring from the control room. Those parameters are still changing. Whatever they set up, it's progressing. How much time do we have?"
- Player can inform Chen of 0800 timeline
- Chen: "That's 90 minutes. I can try to manually override from here, but if they've corrupted the automation system, I might trigger the attack early. You need to find their control mechanism."

#### Beat 6: Multi-System Investigation

**Location:** Control Room, Chemical Storage, Maintenance Wing
**Urgency Stage Transition:** Stage 2 → Stage 3 (Attack Preparation)
**Characters:** Robert Chen (ally), Critical Mass Operative #2 (hostile, optional encounter)

**Investigation Objectives:**
- Correlate VM findings with physical systems
- Identify which dosing stations are compromised
- Locate attack control mechanism (physical or network-based)

**Optional Combat Encounter #2:**
- Second operative patrolling chemical storage area
- Guarding physical access to dosing station controls
- Combat options same as before, but player now more experienced
- Item drop: Master keycard, intelligence document referencing Voltage's location

**Evidence Correlation Phase:**
- Finding 1: Dosing station 3 has physical bypass device installed
- Finding 2: Backup SCADA server has malicious control script (from VM challenge)
- Finding 3: Radio intercept reveals Voltage in maintenance wing coordinating final preparations

**Robert Chen's Assistance:**
- Chen provides technical context for SCADA systems
- Explains how chemical dosing automation works
- Identifies that three attack vectors must ALL be disabled (redundancy)
- Warns that crude shutdown might trigger fail-safe contamination

**0x99 Remote Support:**
- 0x99: "Signals intelligence confirms your findings. Social Fabric cells in three cities are ready to push contamination crisis narratives. This is bigger than one facility."
- 0x99: "New priority—capture Voltage if possible. We need to know the full scope of The Architect's infrastructure initiative."
- 0x99: "But don't risk the mission. If you have to choose between capture and stopping the attack, stop the attack."

**Urgency Indicators (Non-Timer Based):**
- SCADA monitors show yellow/orange status (abnormal parameters)
- Operative radio chatter increasing in frequency and urgency
- Facility alarms showing pre-warning states
- Chen's dialogue reflects growing concern
- Chemical dosing gauges visibly moving toward danger thresholds

#### Beat 7: Attack Vector Identification

**Location:** Maintenance Wing entrance
**Urgency Stage:** Stage 3 (Attack Preparation) → Stage 4 (Final Intervention)

**Complete Intelligence Picture:**
- Three attack vectors identified:
  1. Physical bypass devices on dosing stations 1, 2, 3
  2. Malicious SCADA control script on backup server
  3. Remote trigger mechanism controlled by Voltage

**Strategic Choice Point:**
- **Option A: Systematic Disabling (Thorough):**
  - Disable all three vectors methodically
  - Takes longer but ensures complete neutralization
  - Lower risk of triggering attack
  - Allows Voltage to fortify position

- **Option B: Direct Confrontation (Aggressive):**
  - Confront Voltage immediately to capture trigger mechanism
  - Faster but higher combat risk
  - Voltage may trigger attack if cornered
  - Opportunity to capture operative for intel

- **Option C: Hybrid Approach (Balanced):**
  - Disable physical devices first
  - Then confront Voltage with attack partially neutralized
  - Moderate risk, moderate intel gain

**Narrative Consequence Setup:**
- Choice affects Act 3 difficulty and outcomes
- Thoroughness rewarded with tactical advantages
- Speed creates urgency but higher stakes final confrontation

---

### ACT 3: CRISIS & CHOICE (20-30% of playtime)

**Duration:** 16-24 minutes
**Urgency Stage:** Stage 4 (Final Intervention) → Stage 5 (Resolution)
**Tone:** Race-against-time desperation, action climax, moral complexity

#### Beat 8: Confrontation with Voltage

**Location:** Maintenance Wing - ENTROPY Stronghold
**Characters:** Voltage (Critical Mass leader), Field Operative #3 (if not defeated earlier)

**Environmental Setup:**
- Makeshift command center with SCADA remote access
- Attack trigger laptop visible on table
- Escape route prepared (loading dock access)
- Defensive position (cover, choke points)

**Combat Encounter Design:**

**If Player Arrives After Thorough Preparation:**
- Voltage aware of player approach
- Defensive position but attack vectors already disabled
- Voltage knows attack can't proceed: fights to escape with intel
- Operative #3 covers Voltage's retreat
- Combat difficulty: Moderate
- Capture opportunity: High (Voltage prioritizes escape over triggering failed attack)

**If Player Arrives via Direct Confrontation:**
- Voltage caught off-guard but has active trigger mechanism
- Threatens to trigger attack immediately if approached
- Standoff situation: combat or negotiation
- Combat difficulty: High
- Capture opportunity: Moderate (Voltage uses trigger as leverage)

**Voltage Character Moments:**
- Voltage: "You're good. Better than the usual SAFETYNET drones. But you're too late—this facility's security is a joke. We've been here for three days."
- If player disabled attack: "Smart. But this was never about one water treatment plant. You think stopping this changes anything?"
- If attack still active: "One more step and I trigger it now. 400,000 people drinking contaminated water by noon. Your move."

**Combat Mechanics:**
- Stealth approach: Take down Operative #3 first, isolate Voltage
- Direct combat: Engage both enemies, use cover
- Avoidance: Bypass combat entirely, secure trigger mechanism via alternative route (hacking, environmental puzzle)

**Critical Narrative Choice:**

**CHOICE 1: Capture vs. Disable**

**Option A: Prioritize Capture**
- Attempt to capture Voltage alive for SAFETYNET interrogation
- Risk: Voltage might trigger attack during capture attempt
- Reward: High-value intelligence on The Architect's infrastructure initiative
- Moral dimension: Intelligence might save thousands in future attacks

**Option B: Prioritize Attack Disabling**
- Focus solely on securing/destroying trigger mechanism
- Allows Voltage to escape
- Reward: Guaranteed attack prevention, zero contamination risk
- Moral dimension: Immediate safety over strategic intelligence

**Option C: Attempt Both (Difficult)**
- High-skill approach requiring combat proficiency + speed
- Success: Best outcome (attack stopped, Voltage captured)
- Failure: Voltage escapes OR attack partially triggers

**Player Choice Implementation:**
- Dialogue choice before engagement
- Choice affects combat objectives and difficulty
- No "wrong" choice—both have valid justifications

#### Beat 9: Final Intervention

**Location:** Chemical Storage / Control Room (depending on choice)
**Urgency Stage:** Stage 4 peak intensity

**Scenario A: Attack Trigger Secured (Success Path)**
- Player gains control of trigger laptop
- Robert Chen (radio): "I'm seeing the parameters stabilize. Whatever you did, it's working."
- Final task: Safely disable attack vectors with Chen's technical guidance
- Tension: Careful disabling process (one wrong move could trigger fail-safe)
- Puzzle element: Follow correct shutdown sequence

**Scenario B: Voltage Escaped with Trigger (Partial Success Path)**
- Voltage initiates attack remotely while escaping
- Chen (urgent): "Chemical dosing just spiked! The automation's executing!"
- Emergency intervention: Player must manually override at dosing stations
- Time-sensitive sequence: Disable three stations before contamination threshold
- Success possible but more challenging

**Scenario C: Voltage Captured (Intelligence Path)**
- Voltage in custody but uncooperative
- Player must disable attack without trigger mechanism
- Voltage provides cryptic hints if persuaded (dialogue skill check)
- Alternative: Hack trigger mechanism from recovered laptop
- Chen assists with technical SCADA knowledge

**Environmental Urgency Cues:**
- SCADA monitors flashing red (critical status)
- Alarm systems active
- Chemical dosing gauges in danger zone
- Chen's voice showing stress
- Facility workers being evacuated (if attack progressing)

#### Beat 10: Resolution & Revelation

**Location:** Facility Control Room
**Urgency Stage:** Stage 5 (Resolution)
**Characters:** Robert Chen, Agent 0x99 (phone/video), Voltage (if captured)

**Immediate Aftermath:**

**Full Success (Attack Prevented, Voltage Captured):**
- Chen: "All systems back to normal. Chemical parameters are safe. You... you just saved 400,000 people."
- Voltage in SAFETYNET custody
- Facility secure, no public panic
- Chen grateful but shaken by facility's vulnerabilities

**Partial Success (Attack Prevented, Voltage Escaped):**
- Chen: "We stopped it, but that was too close. Those people—who were they? Why target us?"
- Attack prevented but operatives escaped
- Intelligence limited
- Chen demands answers about facility security

**Minimal Success (Minor Contamination, Attack Mostly Stopped):**
- Chen: "Treatment tanks 2 and 3 have contamination. I'm diverting supply to tank 1 and emergency reserves. We can handle this, but it'll be public."
- Partial attack success—manageable contamination
- Public disclosure required
- Reputational damage to facility

**CHOICE 2: Public Disclosure vs. Quiet Patch**

**Agent 0x99 Presents Choice:**
- 0x99: "The facility is secure. Attack prevented. Now you need to decide how we handle this publicly."

**Option A: Full Public Disclosure**
- Reveal attack attempt and facility vulnerabilities
- Protects public (awareness of infrastructure risks)
- Damages facility reputation, triggers investigation
- Forces security upgrades industry-wide
- Moral: Transparency and public safety

**Option B: Quiet Patch**
- Classify incident, frame as "maintenance issue"
- Protects facility reputation
- Public uninformed of actual risk
- Security patches done quietly
- Moral: Stability and preventing panic

**Option C: Partial Disclosure**
- Acknowledge "security incident" without details
- Balance transparency and stability
- Moderate public awareness
- Controlled narrative

**Robert Chen's Perspective:**
- If disclosed: Angry but understands necessity, fears for facility's future
- If quiet: Relieved but questions if it's right to hide truth from public
- Regardless: Commits to security overhaul

**Major Campaign Revelation:**

**Agent 0x99 Debrief:**
- 0x99: "The intelligence you gathered confirms our worst fears. Critical Mass and Social Fabric were coordinating this attack."
- 0x99: "This wasn't random. Social Fabric was ready with disinformation campaigns in three cities—they planned to amplify the panic from contamination."
- 0x99: "We've intercepted communications mentioning 'The Architect.' Someone is coordinating ENTROPY cells at a level we've never seen before."
- 0x99: "This facility was a test run. The Architect is planning something bigger—coordinated infrastructure attacks with synchronized disinformation campaigns."

**If Voltage Captured:**
- Interrogation excerpt shown (text/audio)
- Voltage confirms multi-cell coordination
- References "OptiGrid Solutions" as Critical Mass front company
- Mentions attacks planned for power grid, transportation, water systems in multiple cities
- Refuses to identify The Architect: "You'll never find them. The Architect doesn't exist in your databases."

**If Voltage Escaped:**
- Communications intercept provides partial intelligence
- Confirms coordination but lacks operational details
- Higher stakes for future missions

**Task Force Null Assignment:**
- 0x99: "SAFETYNET is forming a special task force dedicated to hunting The Architect and dismantling coordinated ENTROPY operations. You're being assigned to Task Force Null."
- 0x99: "This isn't about stopping individual cells anymore. We're going after the network."
- Player acknowledgment—sets up M5-M10 campaign arc

**Final Scene:**

**If Public Disclosure:**
- News broadcast: "Water treatment facility confirms security breach... authorities assure public safety... investigation underway..."
- Robert Chen interview: "We're committed to transparency and security improvements..."

**If Quiet Patch:**
- Facility operating normally
- Chen overseeing security upgrades
- News shows nothing unusual

**Closing Moment:**
- Player exits facility at dawn
- Chen (if parted on good terms): "Thank you. I don't know your real name, but... thank you."
- Agent 0x99 (phone): "Good work. Get some rest. Task Force Null briefing is tomorrow at 0600."
- Camera pans to facility exterior—normal operations, unaware of how close disaster came

**Final Frame:**
- Screen shows intercepted ENTROPY communication (text):
  - "Test run: COMPROMISED. Facility secured by SAFETYNET."
  - "Response from Architect: Expected. Proceed to Phase 2. They cannot stop all of us."
- **End of Mission**
