# Mission 4: "Critical Failure" - Stage 5: Room Design & Puzzle Layout

**Mission ID:** m04_critical_failure
**Stage:** 5 - Room Design and Puzzle Layout
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-12-28

---

## Overview

This document provides detailed room-by-room specifications for Mission 4 "Critical Failure," including object placement, interactive elements, locks, puzzles, combat space design, and item distribution. Each room supports multiple approach paths (stealth, social engineering, combat) while serving narrative and gameplay functions.

---

## Room Design Principles

### Core Design Goals

1. **Multiple Approach Paths:** Every objective accessible via stealth, social, or combat
2. **Environmental Storytelling:** Objects and layout reveal narrative information
3. **Combat Space Viability:** Rooms support both stealth and combat gameplay
4. **Logical Layout:** Facility feels authentic, not gamey
5. **Progression Gates:** Locks and puzzles control pacing without blocking alternatives

### NPCs and Combat

**Voltage (Critical Mass Leader):**
- NPC ID: `npc_voltage`
- Position: ENTROPY command center, near laptop
- Activity: Finalizing attack trigger, monitoring surveillance
- Behavior:
  - **Aware:** Expects player by this point (operatives reported)
  - **Defensive:** Prepared position, tactical advantage
  - **Threatened:** Can trigger attack if player too aggressive
  - **Cornered:** Prioritizes escape if attack fails, capture if no escape

**Operative #3: "Static":**
- NPC ID: `npc_operative_static`
- Position: Supporting Voltage, monitoring area
- Activity: Covering Voltage, surveillance watch
- Behavior:
  - **Alert:** Ready for player arrival
  - **Combat:** Provides cover fire for Voltage
  - **Support:** Defends attack trigger laptop
- Defeat Drops (if defeated separately):
  - `item_entropy_comm_log` (Critical Mass + Social Fabric coordination)
  - `item_voltage_escape_map`
  - `item_attack_planning_usb`

### Combat Space Design

**Defensive Advantages (ENTROPY):**
- Prepared position (Voltage/Static expecting player)
- High ground (generator platform)
- Cover pre-positioned (equipment arranged tactically)
- Escape route prepared (loading dock)

**Player Approach Options:**
- **Direct:** Main entrance, face defensive position head-on
- **Tactical:** Use alcoves and equipment for covered approach
- **Distraction:** Create noise in one area, flank from another
- **Negotiation:** Attempt to talk down Voltage (if attack disabled, he has less leverage)

**Cover Opportunities:**
- Tool benches (full cover, ×2)
- Generator (full cover, large)
- Storage alcoves (full cover, defensive positions)
- HVAC equipment (partial cover)
- Electrical panels (partial cover)

### Critical Choice Implementation (Task 3.1)

**Choice: Capture vs. Disable**

**Prioritize Capture Setup:**
- Player engages Voltage + Static
- Combat difficulty: High
- Goal: Defeat both without damaging laptop
- Risk: Voltage threatens to trigger attack if approached
- Reward: Voltage captured, high-value intelligence

**Prioritize Disable Setup:**
- Player focuses on securing attack trigger laptop
- Bypass or minimize combat
- Goal: Destroy/secure trigger mechanism
- Consequence: Voltage escapes via loading dock
- Benefit: Attack immediately neutralized, lower risk

**Attempt Both (Difficult):**
- High combat skill required
- Defeat Operative #3 quickly
- Capture Voltage before escape
- Secure laptop simultaneously
- Success: Best outcome
- Failure: Partial success (one or the other)

### Locks/Puzzles

**Maintenance Wing Door:**
- Object: `obj_maintenance_wing_door`
  - Type: `door`
  - Locked: Yes
  - Lock Type: Master keycard reader
  - Bypass Options:
    - **Primary:** Master keycard (from Operative #2)
    - **Alternative:** Lockpick (difficult, time-consuming)
    - **Advanced:** Ventilation access (alternate entry route)

### Item Distribution

**From Voltage (if captured):**
- `item_architect_communication` - References The Architect
- `item_multi_cell_operation_plan` - Cross-cell coordination proof
- `item_infrastructure_target_list` - Other facilities at risk

**From Operative #3:**

**Environmental Items:**
- `item_entropy_planning_documents` - On table near laptop
- `item_optigrid_equipment_cases` - Cover identity materials
- `item_facility_access_records` - Shows how they maintained cover

### Approach Paths

**Primary Combat Path:**
1. Enter via main entrance (master keycard)
2. Confront Voltage + Static
3. Choose capture vs. disable approach
4. Engage combat or negotiation
5. Secure laptop and/or capture Voltage

**Alternate Entry (Stealth/Tactical):**
1. Access via ventilation from adjacent room
2. Approach ENTROPY position from unexpected angle
3. Tactical advantage in confrontation

**Post-Confrontation:**
- Secure attack trigger laptop
- Collect intelligence documents
- Proceed to Task 3.2 (disable attack vectors)

### Environmental Storytelling

- ENTROPY operational sophistication (organized command center)
- OptiGrid Solutions cover maintained (equipment branding)
- Escape plan prepared (professional operational security)
- Facility blueprints show deep planning (days of preparation)
- Communications log reveals The Architect coordination
- Well-supplied (food, equipment, escape gear)

3. Access facility from maintenance wing
4. Avoid Security Guard interaction

**Voltage Escape Route:**
1. If Voltage escapes Task 3.1
2. Flees through loading dock door
3. Enters rental van
4. Drives away (cannot be stopped)
5. Mission continues (attack still stoppable)

**Witness Consideration:**
1. Day shift employees arriving
2. If combat occurred here or crisis escalated to Stage 4
3. Public awareness of incident
4. Affects Task 3.3 disclosure decision

### Environmental Storytelling

- Normal facility operations (shift change, deliveries)
- ENTROPY rental van (professional cover - generic rental)
- Tire tracks (recent activity)
- Chemical delivery schedule (clipboard on wall)
- Employees unaware (normalcy juxtaposed with crisis)
