## Overview

This document defines the complete mission objective structure, task breakdown, progression logic, and integration with VM challenges for Mission 4 "Critical Failure." The objective system guides players through facility infiltration, threat investigation, SCADA network analysis, and crisis intervention while supporting multiple playstyles and choices.

---

## Mission Objective Philosophy

### Design Principles

1. **Guided Investigation:** Objectives provide direction without excessive hand-holding
2. **Multiple Approaches:** Tasks support stealth, social engineering, and combat paths
3. **Progressive Discovery:** Early objectives lead naturally to later revelations
4. **Player Agency:** Critical choices reflected in objective structure
5. **VM Integration:** Technical challenges integrated as narrative investigation steps
6. **Clear Success Criteria:** Players always know what needs to be accomplished

### Difficulty Targeting

- **Mission Tier:** Intermediate (Mission 4 of Season 1)
- **Playtime Target:** 60-80 minutes
- **Complexity:** Multi-layered investigation with combat and technical elements
- **Required Skills:** All M1-M3 mechanics + new combat system

---

## Mission Objectives Structure

Mission 4 uses a **3-objective structure** aligned with the 3-act narrative:

## Success and Failure States

### Mission Success Conditions

**Full Success:**
- All required tasks completed
- Attack fully prevented (zero contamination)
- Attack vectors identified and disabled
- Optional: Voltage captured, all operatives neutralized, complete intelligence gathered

**Partial Success:**
- All required tasks completed
- Attack mostly prevented (minor containable contamination)
- Attack vectors identified but some delay in disabling
- Voltage escaped but attack stopped

**Minimal Success:**
- All required tasks completed
- Attack prevented but with consequences (facility damage, partial contamination)
- Public disclosure required
- Operatives escaped

**Mission Failure:**
- NOT POSSIBLE in current design
- Attack can always be stopped (narrative-driven urgency, not timer)
- Worst case is minimal success with consequences

### Task Failure Handling

**Combat Defeats:**
- Player respawns at previous checkpoint
- Operative remains in position (can retry)
- No permanent failure state

**Investigation Delays:**
- No time-based failures
- Thoroughness rewarded with easier final encounter
- Rushing creates harder but still winnable confrontation

**VM Challenge Difficulty:**
- Hints available (Robert Chen provides SCADA context)
- Flag station accepts flags when found (no time limit)
- Can leave and return to VM (progress saved)

---

## Objective Progression Logic

### Unlocking System

**Linear Unlocking (Required Path):**
- Objective 1 must complete before Objective 2 unlocks
- Objective 2 must complete before Objective 3 unlocks
- Within objectives, some tasks unlock sequentially (investigation flow)

**Parallel Unlocking (Within Objectives):**
- Task 2.9 and 2.10 (combat) can be done during Objective 2 investigation
- VM challenges can be approached in player's preferred order (after 2.1)
- Attack vector disabling (Task 3.2) can be done in any order

**Choice-Based Branching:**
- Task 3.1 outcome affects Task 3.2 difficulty (not availability)
- Task 3.3 disclosure choice affects narrative outcome (not mission completion)

### Event System Integration

**Key Events:**

1. **`enter_room` events:**
   - Trigger task completion (entry-based tasks)
   - Unlock new areas and objectives

2. **`npc_conversation` events:**
   - Track dialogue progress via knot completion
   - Unlock investigation tasks

3. **`custom_objective_complete` events:**
   - Flexible completion triggers for complex tasks
   - VM challenges, combat, investigation

4. **`flag_submitted` events:**
   - Track VM flag submissions
   - Unlock next investigation phase

5. **`global_variable_changed` events:**
   - Mission-critical states (attack_disabled, voltage_captured)
   - Trigger finale sequences

**Event Emission Examples:**

```json
{
  "type": "emit_event",
  "event_name": "scada_anomalies_identified",
  "description": "Player discovered SCADA compromise"
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "emit_event",
  "event_name": "attack_vectors_identified",
  "description": "All three attack mechanisms discovered"
}
```

## Integration with Urgency Stages

### Stage 1: Infiltration (Objective 1)
- Objective: Infiltrate and confirm threat
- Urgency: Low, investigative pace
- Visual: Green SCADA, normal operations
- Player can explore freely

### Stage 2: System Compromise (Early Objective 2)
- Objective: Begin SCADA investigation
- Urgency: Moderate, active investigation
- Visual: Yellow warnings appearing
- Player has time for thorough VM work

### Stage 3: Attack Preparation (Late Objective 2)
- Objective: Complete investigation, prepare intervention
- Urgency: High, attack imminent
- Visual: Orange/red warnings, alarms pre-warning
- Player understanding full scope before confrontation

### Stage 4: Final Intervention (Objective 3, Tasks 3.1-3.2)
- Objective: Confront Voltage, disable attack
- Urgency: Maximum, crisis moment
- Visual: Red emergency, alarms active
- Combat and crisis decisions

### Stage 5: Resolution (Task 3.3)
- Objective: Debrief and choices
- Urgency: Declining, stabilizing
- Visual: Systems returning to normal
- Reflection and consequences

**Key Design Note:** Urgency stages progress through player actions (task completion), NOT real-time timers. Player controls pacing.

## Success Criteria for Objectives

### Clarity:
- 90%+ players understand what each task requires
- Objective descriptions clear without being patronizing
- Next steps logically flow from current tasks

### Pacing:
- 70%+ players complete mission in 60-80 minute target
- No single task feels excessively long or tedious
- Investigation and combat balanced

### Player Agency:
- Multiple approach paths supported (stealth, combat, social)
- Optional tasks feel valuable but not mandatory
- Choices have visible consequences

### VM Integration:
- 85%+ players understand why they're doing VM challenges (narrative context)
- Flag submission tasks clearly communicated
- VM difficulty appropriate for intermediate players

## Next Stage Preparation

**Stage 5: Room Design and Puzzle Layout**
- Detailed room-by-room layout
- Object placement and interactions
- Lock and puzzle design
- Combat encounter space design
- Item placement and loot distribution
- Environmental puzzle integration

**Key Questions for Stage 5:**
- How do rooms support multiple approach paths?
- What objects and interactions are in each room?
- Where are locks and how do players bypass them?
- How does room design support combat + stealth?

---

**Status:** Stage 4 Complete - Ready for Stage 5
**Estimated Development Time:** 12-14 hours for Stage 4 documentation complete
**Quality Assessment:** Comprehensive objective system with clear task structure, VM integration, player choice implementation, and narrative-driven progression without real-time timers

*Stage 4 establishes the complete player-facing objective structure for Mission 4, providing clear guidance while supporting multiple playstyles and meaningful choices. The task system integrates VM challenges as narrative investigation steps, combat encounters as optional tactical advantages, and critical decisions as branching outcomes—all while maintaining tension through stage-based urgency rather than countdown timers.*
