# Each test is labelled SECURITY to make failures conspicuous in CI output.
# Tests labelled BUG CONFIRMED reproduce a known vulnerability and are

  # Flag Station vs Launch Device — cross-submission ownership bug
  #
  # A flag that belongs to a launch-device room object must NOT be accepted at
  # a flag-station, and vice versa. The `stationId` param is the client's way
  # of telling the server which device the player is interacting with; the
  # server must verify that the submitted flag actually belongs to that device.
  #
  # BUG: find_flag_station_for_flag only checks obj['type'] == 'flag-station'
  # in the primary room-object search, so launch-device objects in rooms are
  # invisible to it. When it returns nil the ownership check is silently
  # skipped, the wrong station accepts the flag, and the launch device later
  # rejects it as "already submitted".
