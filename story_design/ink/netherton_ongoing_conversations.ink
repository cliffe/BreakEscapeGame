Netherton: The Field Operations Handbook. *adjusts glasses slightly*

Netherton: I co-wrote the original edition twenty years ago. I've personally overseen every revision since. Edition 7, Revision 23, 847 pages across 23 sections.

Netherton: Agents often mock the handbook. The contradictions, the excessive detail, the seemingly absurd specificity. But every regulation exists for a reason.

Netherton: *brief pause, something that might be surprise*

Netherton: Few agents take the handbook seriously until they've been in the field long enough to understand why it exists.

Netherton: The fact that you're already engaging with it thoughtfully... that speaks well of your judgment.

Netherton: Section 14.7 is particularly relevant to your current assignment level. I recommend thorough review.

#respect_gained:10

=== handbook_contradictions ===
~ npc_netherton_respect += 8
#respect_gained:8

Netherton: An astute observation. The contradictions are not accidents.

Netherton: Field operations exist in legal and ethical gray areas. We operate under authorities that are classified, in situations that are unpredictable.

Netherton: The handbook provides guidance for contradictory circumstances. Agents must exercise judgment about which regulation applies to their specific situation.

Netherton: It's not a rulebook. It's a framework for decision-making under impossible conditions.

#respect_gained:8
-> phase_1_hub

=== handbook_honest_confusion ===
~ npc_netherton_respect += 5
#respect_gained:5

Netherton: Understandable. The handbook is not designed for easy consumption.

Netherton: Focus on sections 8 through 12 for field operations. Sections 14 through 18 for technical protocols. The appendices can be referenced as needed.

Netherton: Your handler will guide you on relevant sections for specific situations. No one memorizes the entire handbook.

Netherton: Leadership principles. *straightens papers on desk*

Netherton: I've held command positions for over two decades. Military intelligence, civilian agencies, and now SAFETYNET.

Netherton: The core principle remains constant: leadership is responsibility. You are accountable for every person under your command and every outcome of their actions.

* [Ask how he handles that weight]

~ npc_netherton_respect += 15
#respect_gained:15

Netherton: *considers the question carefully*

Netherton: You don't "handle" it. You carry it. Every decision, every mission, every agent deployed—the weight accumulates.

Netherton: I've sent agents into situations where they were hurt. I've made calls that cost missions. I've lost... *brief pause* ...I've had agents not return.

Netherton: The weight never lessens. You simply become stronger at carrying it. Or you break. Those are the options in command.

<> *looks directly at you*

Netherton: That you're asking this question suggests you may be suited for leadership yourself. Eventually.

Netherton: Structured. Disciplined. By the handbook—because the handbook represents accumulated wisdom from thousands of operations.

Netherton: Some call me rigid. Perhaps. But structure keeps agents alive. Discipline prevents mistakes. Standards maintain operational integrity.

Netherton: I demand excellence because the work demands it. Lives depend on our precision. I will not lower standards to make agents more comfortable.

<> *slight softening*

Netherton: But I do not demand perfection. I demand learning. Mistakes are acceptable if they result in growth. Repeated mistakes indicate insufficient attention.

~ npc_netherton_respect += 5
#respect_gained:5
~ npc_netherton_serious_conversations += 1

Netherton: SAFETYNET's history. This is not widely documented for security reasons.

Netherton: The organization was founded in the late 1990s during the early internet boom. The founders recognized that cyber threats would become existential before governments were prepared.

Netherton: I joined during the formative years. Helped write operational protocols. Built the training program. Developed the handbook from field experience and hard lessons.

Netherton: We've evolved from a small group of specialists to a global operation. But the mission remains: protect critical infrastructure from those who would weaponize technology.

#respect_gained:12

Netherton: Chaotic. Improvised. We were writing the procedures as we executed operations.

Netherton: Small teams, minimal oversight, operating in legal territory that didn't yet exist. The handbook's first edition was 47 pages. Now it's 847.

Netherton: Every page added represents a lesson learned. Often painfully.

<> *rare hint of warmth*

Netherton: But we were building something important. Creating capabilities that would become essential. That purpose drove us through the chaos.

Netherton: We still carry that founding mission. Even though the organization has grown, even though operations are more structured—the core purpose remains.

=== history_entropy_emergence ===
~ npc_netherton_respect += 10
#respect_gained:10

Netherton: ENTROPY as an organized network appeared approximately five years ago. Though precursor activities date back further.

Netherton: Initially we tracked disparate threat actors. Then patterns emerged. Coordination. Shared resources. Unified philosophical framework.

Netherton: By the time we recognized it as a network, ENTROPY had already infiltrated numerous systems and organizations. We've been fighting catch-up since.

Netherton: They adapt quickly. They learn from our countermeasures. They recruit effectively. They're the most sophisticated adversary SAFETYNET has faced.

Netherton: Which is why we require agents of your caliber.

Netherton: What I expect from agents. *interlaces fingers, formal posture*

Netherton: First: Competence. Master your technical skills. Maintain physical readiness. Develop field craft. Excellence is not optional.

Netherton: Second: Judgment. I can teach techniques. I cannot teach wisdom. You must develop the capacity to make sound decisions under pressure.

Netherton: Third: Integrity. The power we wield is enormous. The oversight is minimal. Your personal ethics are the only reliable safeguard against abuse.

Netherton: Difficult command decisions. *removes glasses, cleans them methodically*

Netherton: Every operation presents choices where all options have negative consequences. You select the least worst option and accept the cost.

Netherton: The Berlin Crisis. Two years ago. Agent captured, ENTROPY preparing exposure. Every extraction option carried unacceptable risks.

<> *rare vulnerability*

Netherton: I authorized an extraction that cost us intelligence assets, burned operations across Europe, and required protocol violations I cannot discuss.

Netherton: Then you accept that you made the best call available with the information you had. And you carry the weight of the consequences.

<> *quiet*

Netherton: The agent I extracted wrote me a letter. Thanked me for the choice. Said they understood the cost and were grateful I paid it.

Netherton: I miss the simplicity of being responsible only for my own performance. Not carrying the weight of everyone under my command.

Netherton: Each one... *removes glasses* ...each one is permanent. Every name. Every mission. Every decision point where maybe I could have chosen differently.

Netherton: Agent Karim. Moscow operation. Intelligence failure led to ambush. She held position long enough for her team to extract. Died buying them time.

Netherton: Agent Torres. Infrastructure infiltration. Equipment malfunction. Fell during a climb. Instant.

Netherton: Yes. Every one.

Netherton: I review each loss exhaustively. Mission analysis. Decision trees. Alternative approaches. I identify every point where different choices might have changed outcomes.

Netherton: Sometimes the conclusion is that nothing could have prevented it. Operational hazards. Equipment failures beyond prediction. Enemy actions we couldn't have anticipated.

Netherton: That analysis is... not comforting. Even when the loss was unavoidable, the responsibility remains.

<> *long pause*

Netherton: Agent Karim's family received a letter saying she died in a training accident. Classified operations. They can't know she died a hero. Can't know the three agents she saved.

Netherton: Deliberate civilian casualties. We accept collateral damage when unavoidable. We never target civilians deliberately. Mission success never justifies civilian deaths.

Netherton: Illegal orders. I've refused orders from oversight I believed were unlawful or unethical. I've instructed agents to refuse illegal commands even from me.

Netherton: Personal gain. We serve the mission. Not ourselves. The moment we use operational authority for personal benefit, we become what we fight.

Netherton: Then I accept that I made a choice that harmed someone. That I prioritized mission success over individual welfare. That the math of protecting thousands justified hurting dozens.

Netherton: And I question whether that math is ever truly justified. Whether there was an alternative I failed to see. Whether I'm rationalizing harm.

<> *removes glasses*

Netherton: Consistent excellent performance. But more than that—consistent excellent judgment.

Netherton: You've faced morally complex situations. Made difficult choices. Shown you understand the ethical weight of our work.

Netherton: You ask meaningful questions. You challenge assumptions respectfully. You demonstrate you're thinking deeply about the work, not just following orders.

Netherton: You prioritize agent welfare. I've reviewed your mission reports. You take risks to protect team members. That shows proper values.

<> *rare warmth*

Netherton: And you've engaged with me as a person, not just as authority. Asked about the weight of command. The personal cost. Shown genuine interest in understanding leadership.

Netherton: That combination—competence, ethics, thoughtfulness, humanity—that earns trust.

Netherton: The fact that you trust me completely, that you'd say so directly—

<> *quiet*

Netherton: Thank you. Genuinely. That means more than most commendations I've received.

Netherton: I will continue to earn that trust. To make decisions worthy of it. To command in ways that honor it.

        Netherton: Your technical skills are exceptional. Your judgment is sound. Your ethics are intact despite pressures that corrupt many agents.

        Netherton: You demonstrate leadership qualities that suggest you'll eventually command your own division. When that time comes, I'll recommend you without reservation.

        <> *rare genuine warmth*

        Netherton: More than that—you've reminded me why this work matters. Why developing agents is worthwhile. You represent what SAFETYNET should be.

Netherton: Life beyond protocols. *removes glasses, rare informal gesture*

Netherton: The handbook defines my professional life. Protocols structure every decision. Regulations govern every action.

Netherton: But protocols don't cover everything. The handbook doesn't address... *searches for words* ...the human elements.

Netherton: How to maintain humanity while executing inhumane operations. How to care for agents while sending them into danger. How to balance mission success against personal cost.

Netherton: *long pause, genuine vulnerability*

Netherton: Conscience. Imperfect, uncertain conscience.

Netherton: I make choices I believe are right. I prioritize agent welfare when I can. I refuse operations I find morally unacceptable.

Netherton: But I don't have a system for it. No protocol. Just... judgment. Developed over decades. Sometimes wrong.

<> *quiet*

Netherton: I think about the agents I've commanded. What I would want if I were in their position. How I'd want to be led.

Netherton: I remember why I joined this work. To protect people. To serve something meaningful. When I'm uncertain, I return to that purpose.

Netherton: And sometimes... *rare admission* ...I ask myself what agents like you would think. Whether decisions I'm considering would earn or lose your trust.

Netherton: That's not in the handbook. But it's what guides me when protocols aren't enough.

Netherton: *slight bitter smile*

Netherton: Very little. Work consumed most of what could have been life.

Netherton: I read. History, mostly. Biography. Philosophy. Trying to understand how others have grappled with moral complexity and impossible choices.

Netherton: I run. Early mornings. Helps clear my head. Provides structure beyond operational schedules.

Netherton: I have an apartment I rarely see. No hobbies worth mentioning. Few friends. The work is... most of what I am.

<> *pause*

Netherton: I don't recommend that path. I ended up here through decades of choices, each one seeming reasonable at the time. Accumulated into isolation.

Netherton: Maintain balance better than I did. Have life outside the agency. Don't let the work consume everything.

<> *rare direct advice*

Netherton: You're talented enough that the work will demand everything if you allow it. Don't. Preserve some part of yourself the agency doesn't own.

Netherton: Precisely. *approving*

Netherton: The handbook provides framework. Guidelines. Accumulated wisdom. But it can't make decisions for you.

Netherton: Every operation requires judgment that transcends protocols. Ethical choices. Risk assessments. Human factors the handbook can't quantify.

Netherton: That's why agent selection is critical. Why I invest so heavily in development. Because ultimately, individual judgment determines outcomes.

Netherton: The fact that you understand that—that protocols are tools, not replacements for thinking—that's part of why you're effective.
